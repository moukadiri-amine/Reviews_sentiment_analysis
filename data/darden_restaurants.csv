"Remains my favorite restaurant in NYC. I visit about once a month since it's by my work. I also tend to take out-of-town guests here. The steaks are always prepared very well and the sharable sides really are shareable. The staff has the upmost professionalism and are extremely educated in their product. Wine lockers are cool and the wine list, via iPad, is extensive and diverse. The Paul Hobbs cabernet is my favorite and I'm delighted they carry it there. xo",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Probably torn between a 2 and a 3, but I'll be generous. Utterly uninspiring for a group dinner, but group dinners tend to have worse food and service from restaurants than normal meals (hence the 3 vs 2 stars). Our three course prix fixe included a salad, choice of filet, chicken, or salmon, and a selection of desserts which included the espresso cake, cheesecake, and fresh berries. Bread service to start was standard, though I did appreciate that the bread was warm and that there was a large selection. The salad course was utterly dismal - it looked and tasted like they tossed a bag of salad from the local Food Emporium onto a plate with some dressing. Some people had nothing on their plates except for lettuce, and the 'parmesan' that they promised on the menu was nonexistent. Luckily I had half a cherry tomato and a tiny shred of carrot to break the monotony. My main was a medium rare filet, which was fine (for a steak restaurant of the caliber that Capital Grille tries to be, the steak should be at least fine). It came with a pitiful pile of plain arugula that I didn't touch. I also tried my friend's salmon, which was again fine but nothing special. The mains were supposed to come with sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, but our table didn't receive those until 20 minutes after everyone had gotten their main dishes, despite asking where they were several times. By that time, all the food was getting cold. By the end of our entrees, it was clear they were trying to hurry us out as the waiters  cleared everyone's plates as soon as it looked like they were done eating, nevermind the status of the rest of the table. Dessert was probably the highlight of the meal, offering up some solid classics. I especially liked the cheesecake, which struck a balance between decadence and lightness. Bottom line - there are much better steakhouses in Manhattan, and even in FiDi. Go somewhere that's not a chain when you're in this city, save Capital Grille for when you're stuck elsewhere.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"If  you made a lot of money that day in the stock market and it's burning your packet,  that's the perfect place for you. Love  the wine  selection but food is nothing special . Too much extra dressing , too much extra souses, gives you that heavy feelings afterwards. But overall if you want to feel like big shot ,  go for it.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
I really wanted to give it a four-star as I enjoyed the restaurant week menu very much last year. 5 star service for sure though. Lunch was crowded but we had reservation at 12pm. We were seated downstairs and had the room to ourselves for three minutes before it was filled up quickly. New England clam chowder was good as it wasn't salty like what I had in many restaurants. The dry aged sirloin was truly disappointing. We ordered medium rare and it was really dry and tough to eat. We had to ask for some steak sauce which only helped a bit. My friend loved her her cream brûlée and my flourless chocolate espresso cake was pretty good. The coffee was perfect and I loved it when the milk was warm.,3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"*This is a NYC Restaurant Week review** Had to find anything wrong at the famous Capital Grille. Service throughout the meal was spot on. Very attentive and never waited longer than 5 mins for bread to be replenished or a drink to be refilled. The items I chose were the Caesar Salad, Salmon & the Creme brûlée. All 3 items were what you would hope for. Good portion of Salad not drowned in dressin. Salmon cooked perfectly medium with a wonderful honey glazed reduction (could have used a tad more sauce) and finished off with a delicious creme brûlée that with just a little bit more crunch on the top would have made it perfect! All in all this place was well deserving of the 5 stars.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The dessert here is amazing!!!! So make sure you have enough space for the dessert. Great service, good food and amazing dessert. Old classic steak house with good vibe. The special of the day was lobster bisque and that was good! Lots of lobster in it. Steaks here are  very straight forward simple one. Make sure to ask for an additional sauce so that you can enjoy more flavor. We ordered T-bone steak and Filet Mignon. Preferred the filet mignon. My recommendation for the dessert is coconut cream pie. Big and shareable portion. That is delicious. This is a very classic steakhouse. Nothing really special but you cannot go wrong here. The service staff Deric answered all our questions and very helpful. Thank you Deric!",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The food (steak, tuna, etc) is consistently good. However, we decided to stop going there. In other restaurants such as Mark's Joseph and Tribeca Grills, we are recognized and greeted like friends/family after eating at those places 3 or 4 times.  Yes, I am superficial and being recognized feeds my ego :-).  Capital Grille does not even seem to care that we went there a lot.  So, we stop going there now.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Capital grille is within my work building at 120 Broadway. What I love about my building itself is the ceiling which was featured in Wolf of Wall Street! As soon as you enter capital grille you hear the numerous business conversations as you pass by to find a seat at the bar. If you choose to sit by the bar, the service is great. The bartenders are friendly and are accommodating to how you would like your drink. You'll always here one business man call them by them name and say ""the usual"". I cane here with my boss  for business right before the our holiday party. He knew the waiter by his name, Brian. He was extremely Accommodating in providing me with a vegetarian pasta option. The pasta was delicious and the portion was amazing. For drinks I had 3 rounds of stoli doli! What I LOVE about capital grill is that their drinks are STRONG. Now there have been times where it is a bit overwhelming so I recommend giving this feedback to your waiter as they are extremely accommodating and nice to adjust your drink preference. I have great memories at this Capital Grill in particular as it is where my company and I spent out boss's last day. My boss was nice enough to get an gorgeous room in which sat over 10 people. We were able to shut the doors of the room to silence the business chit chats of the main floor. We were told the chefs special which sounded drool worthy but we stuck to appetizers and drinks. The service was great, the food was delicious and the drinks were able to keep me calm for the awkward conversations that were occasionally Carried out throughout the night This place is expensive but what do you expect? You're on Wall Street baby",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Came here for a team lunch to celebrate the holidays. The decor was really nice and we got seated upstairs. Appetizer was a choice of clam chowder and salad. I opted for the salad. Simple yet flavorful. For mains I chose the lobster and crab burger. I think there were three other options, one is grilled salmon and maybe a steak sandwich and a grilled chicken? The lobster and crab patty was legit with chunky flakes of the shellfish. Just a little bit too salty to my liking. Otherwise it would have been perfect. It also came with green beans and mashed potato to share. Dessert was my favorite part of the lunch. The dessert platter includes a cup of mixed berries topped with some creme anglaise, a slice of super rich flourless chocolate cake which is to die for and a simple creme brûlée. It's meant to be shared but I want to finish the whole thing! It's that good :)",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Love this place for the restaurant week deals! The services were very good even during the busy days. Make sure to make reservations before the visit. This place tends to get very crowded, especially during lunch. The steak salad was just the right amount that I needed. Plus the dessert, yum! I always get the cheesecake, which is creamy with hard caramel top (similar to a creme brulee). It's definitely something unusual.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
I got aged strip steak brushed with foiegra butter. It was yummy but had some tough grain on it. The seared tuna with sesame was awesome. Thick cut and very fresh. Blueberry sorbet was very refreshing and full of flavor. Flourless chocolate was amazing. Very chocolatey and went well with espresso infusion.,5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I went to this Capital Grille venue for the first time for Restaurant Week, at lunch. The atmosphere and design is the one of a classic American BBQ restaurant, classy, elegant, and perfect for business dining. I dined upstairs, and the service was spot-on. Fast with great manners. I do love when between each meal the server pickup bread crumbs with the silver sweeper. I had a Cesar salad, the salmon, and the flower less cacao and coffee cake. Salad was perfect; the salmon delicious with a tasty honey glaze and a side of green beans; the cake was intense, really smooth. My boyfriend had a cup of clam chowder, the filet and the cream brûlé. Overall all very good. We both added a glass of wine to our lunches, but it was pretty expensive ($18/glass!) and a coffee afterwords. Total for two lunches, two glasses of wine, and a coffee was over $110. I would say it was a really good dining experience and a place where I would definitely eat to at least once, if you find yourself around Wall Street.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Mixed reviews about the steaks. In my party of 9, some of us had great steaks but some of of us had steaks that were way over cooked. Sides were all delicious. Especially the creamed spinach, and string beans with tomatoes. We also had mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The New England clam chowder appetizer was pretty standard. The creme brûlée and coffee were pretty good. We had a lovely private room and the service was wonderful. I would definitely come back for the room with a large group or a date night.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The Capital Grille doesn't disappoint if you are preapared to pay a bit more. It is worth it! My mom and I had a picture perfect birthday dinner there. Starting with being greeted properly and fullfilling the request for a quiet table upstairs the staff did everything to make her feel special. A delicious birthay dessert on the house included. The food was amazing and everything was perfectly cooked & prepared. Already the complimentary bread basket with real "" european style butter"" is worth to be mentioned. We had a salad for starters & then the fillet mignon, the salmon, creamed spinach, parmesan truffle fries & wild mushrooms. Our waiter, Keith, was very polite & attentive and took excellent care of us. All over all an extremely successful & pleasing birthday dinner experience - like the other dinners we had there before.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"We go to every capital grille we can when we visit a new city. This location was of course gorgeous inside and we have the most exceptional service at the bar from Max. He was so professional and courteous and helpful. We recommend trying the Stoli Doli. It's pineapple infused soli vodka. Dangerously delicious. The prices are so totally worth the quality of service, food, setting, everything. Everything is amazing! Shout out to Max for being such a great bar tender!!",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The Capital Grille is certainly one of those consistent, traditional steakhouses that doesn't disappoint but certainly doesn't wow you either. My family and I made a reservation for Easter Brunch and were seated at a nice window table. I don't think there are any bad seats in the restaurant though. The bread basket was amazing, with an assortment of hot, toasted rolls and sweet muffins. We had a child with us and she was given a bunny coloring book. Brunch is an amazing deal -- for $49, you have an appetizer, entree (including a filet mignon option), and a dessert. Plus you can choose from juices, coffee, or teas -- or $12 for bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. We had the sweetest waiter who was courteous and didn't up sell at any point. The steaks and the complimentary green beans were delicious as well. Definitely would be back.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"This place is amazing. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed. We order the garlic shrimp appetizer, clam chowder and wedge salad to start with. Everything was delicious.

"Get the filet mignon!  You will NOT be disappointed.  Side of green beans and potatoes.  Yum!  Although next time I'll just get the meat.. who needs those veggie fillers - am I right? Service was good too.  It was surprisingly packed for a Tuesday lunch!  They have a nice bar area too but I wasn't about that ""let's drink during work hours"" life.  Maybe need to try the bar after work some time",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"This place is AMAZING! Honestly, I cannot write this review without first acknowledging our amazing waiter! His name is Frederick aka Derick and he accommodated our tastes far past the average service of usual waiters. After we got seated, he thoroughly went through the menu with us and had us sample wines based on our taste preference. He didn't stop until we were completely satisfied!!! ( the wine list is also extremely extensive so this is saying a lot). Not only that, but he recommended pairings based on our entrees and also had us try a complimentary appetizer just for us to try ! It was a tomato mozzarella which contained sauces that completely enamored my senses! The mozzarella was so fresh, it practically crumbled with each bite. I was completely blown away by him and I'm sure my experience would not have been as amazing if it weren't for him. Aside from this, the ribeye had a beautiful flavor with fatty cuts of meat on the edges cut to perfection ( as most ribeyes are) and my burger was cooked medium which gave it a juicy flavor that complimented the sharp taste of the cheese. The creme brûlée was also the best I ever had from any other steakhouse ( and I've been to many!) . Loved this place and our waiter! Will definitely be coming back. Just a side note: GET THE LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE IT IS PHENOMENAL. You won't be disappointed .",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Wow! Just had an amazing lunch here with my friend. Everything was on point....Food, drinks, service. Our server Chris M. made excellent drink recommendations and he was super attentive, but not overly so. I had the lobster and crab burger with truffles fries.

"If you're in the mood for a quiet dinner/drinks and are okay with spending more then come here. Just don't sit at the bar. Torn between 2/3 stars, I gave two because of the cost/service. I frequent this restaurant because it's conveniently located but for the price of both drinks and food I definitely expect more. There are a few employees that provide outstanding service, but unfortunately there are several that don't. The food is good, what you would expect at a steakhouse, unless it sits under the heat lamps for 45 mins. And because the price doesn't change I'll probably choose another pricey place that provides both service AND food in the future.",2.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Capital grille is a downtown landmark where no choice can go wrong. If you're looking for a quiet evening with old world luxury this is the place to do it. Limited vegetarian selection but I mean you could have probably guessed that. As usual very good steak, mashed potatoes, and cheesecake. The holy trio of a steak house. Be wary that the steak here doesn't come with any sides, you'll have to order them separately. As someone who hates fat and bones in his steak, the bone in filet was the best meat I've ever had. Non steak courses & appetizers are also good, but I would say keep that appetite big and focus on the steak. You can get a salad from sweet green any day.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I ate here with a party of eight on January 30, 2018.  We ordered a variety of appetizers for the table to share, individual steaks cooked to our different tastes, as well as a variety of sides to complement the meal.  Overall, the food was very good and the services was outstanding across the board from the hostess, coat check guy, and our waiter..  I got a porterhouse marinated in a balsamic vinegar / fresh pepper combination that was very good and I would recommend it.  I would also recommend the grilled shrimp as an appetizer and sautéed mushrooms as a side.  Unfortunately for us, we were all too full for dessert.  The décor was great, and make sure you check out the massive old vault in the basement if you head to the restrooms downstairs - you just don't have this ambiance at most places in the USA.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Came in for restaurant week. I got the cob salad with blue cheese dressing which wasn't anything too exciting/memorable. For my entree I ordered the dry aged NY strip. seasoned enough but I just with the grill was hot enough to put a crust on the steak but still be medium rare, if that makes any sense....  we also ordered Lobster mac and cheese which was very disappointing watery/bland/no lobster/just bad. Brussels sprout were good but I think they could've been better as they weren't all all the way cooked, therefore, some bites were bitter. Restaurant week side are Mash or Green beans with had both on the table because we all just shared. But if you cant decide on what to pick GO FOR THE GREEN BEAN. I had ordered the mash because I'm a potato and steak kind of girl but those string beans are the most memorable dish of the night lol. Creme brulee did not have a hard top but it was delicious non the less. FYI- if they don't cook your steak to your liking they will remake you another one and wait for you to cut into that steak to make sure you are satisfy. No, I wouldn't come back. why? because even though my steak was good, it wasn't memorable. it just tasted like a NY strip I make at home. But it was great choice for Restaurant week and trying out the food for a cheaper price. Would definitely recommend for restaurant week.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Walking in, you get a very relaxed vibe from the restaurant and you're greeted by the nice staff. The only problem was that our waitress forgot small things like water and getting more butter after asking a few times for it. Besides this, the steak tastes fine, the sides such as mac and cheese and fries are even better. The highlight is definitely the seafood. Everything is very flavorful and is worth coming back to.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Went here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I love the atmosphere. When calling to make reservations I asked if they do anything special for a birthday celebration. They put his name on our menus wishing him a happy birthday! They also decorated the table with confetti and wrote him a personal happy birthday card from the restaurant . Which made it very special to us. Then they brought out free dessert of a apiece of chocolate cake and cheese cake with fruit and two glasses of champagne. Everything we ordered was delicious. Fresh mozzarella and tomato plate, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, scallops with mushroom risotto and steak. Walking in we were immediately greeted with friendly smileys.

"Great lunch at the Capital Grille in the Financial District.  Great table on the main floor where you check in.  Very professional service and very knowledgeable wait staff.  Started with the lump crabmeat cocktail and the waiter suggested adding large shrimp to it.  Great suggestion and super good sauce served with it.  We also had the steak tartare appetizer which was really good as well.  I had the seared tuna entree, cooked rare with sesame crust.  Absolutely top notch.  The tuna was cooked perfectly, the sticky rice it came with was great as were the three sauces served with it.  Could not have been better and a great recommendation by the waiter.  We had the brussel sprouts as a side and there were great also.  Very favorable.  Overall a great lunch in the Financial District.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

We love fine dining, and had just eaten at Ruth Chris the night before and Tavern on the Green that day for Brunch. The Capital Grille did not disappoint. From the perfection of the steaks to the large size of the sides and salads we had a fabulous experience. We will most definitely come back to visit the next time we are in the city. I had to get a ""to go"" bag because I was so full. That is usually not the case I'm fine dining where the plates are huge and the food is tiny. Worth the money!

"Came for Restaurant Week with a couple of friends and it was pretty solid. I find that the quality tends to diminish in some restaurants for RW but fortunately that wasn't the case here. The clam chowder was decent, not too fishy/clammy. I had the petite filet mignon which was cooked just as I had asked. It was tender and well seasoned with a nice crust. I also tried some of my friend's bone-in NY strip which was just as good. The creme brulee was delicious as well.

"Really good and really expensive sums up my experience at The Capital Grille. I was meeting an old friend downtown and he loves steak, so I figured we would pay The Capital Grille a visit. First of all, finding The Capital Grille is difficult. If the Wall Street area isn't confusing enough, the restaurant has 1 address but the actual entrance is literally a block away. When we arrived we received a very friendly greeting from the hostesses who quickly showed us to our table. Our server was very nice but he definitely tried to steer us towards the most expensive menu items - granted my friend and I were well dressed having just come from work, but damn! We had: - Shrimp Cocktail - very good and fresh - Petite Filet Mignon - very good, perfectly cooked - Bone In Filet Mignon - my friend loved - Fresh Spinach - good, but I would have preferred creamed - Mashed Potatoes - delicious We had a wonderful meal, but it cost us over $100 a person and we didn't have anything to drink.

The Capital Grille has one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I took my wife Chi here to celebrate her birthday dinner and the bone-in ribeye was outstanding.  It's also pretty cool that in the basement is the original Federal Reserve of New York Vault.  It's one of those darker private meeting near Wall Street old world steak houses.  We really enjoyed it.,5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
Amazingly beautiful experience- what a magnificent hidden treasure off of Lower Broadway. It is true to its name 'Capital' as it holds all of the big players for the finest meals in the area. ALWAYS make reservations- it's always busy - but the waitstaff & the front desk are superb!  We had the Waygu beef pairing with wine - it was just perfect! The wines are all exquisitely matched - BTW the waygu beef is featured as a fabulous burger! Outstanding burger and served with the truffle fries! We added the grilled asparagus. I could not finish my meal so they packaged it up - with a thank you note from the Chef! Oh BTW attention to detail is at its finest here - I was wearing a black dress & they knew to give me a black linen napkin- rather than white as to not add lint to your dress! Deserts are delicious & not to be missed!,5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

As for the food: - I got the dry-aged Kona, which was delicious and so flavorful! The shallot butter was also a nice complement to the steak. - Lobster Mac was delicious and the bread crumbs on top added a nice crisp factor. Also had plenty of lobster! - Creamed spinach was not my fave at all - had a strange taste - Truffle fries - good truffle flavor, but needed some salt The staff was super accommodating and very polite - they got the birthday girl a complimentary glass of champagne AND cheesecake, which I must say was really good and moussey!

"Came here with a group of 12 for a business meeting and dinner in the downstairs Private Dining area. As we walked downstairs, the first thing we noticed was the cool huge vault door entrance. Of course my group and I took photos in front of it. To the right of the room was what I believe private lockers for customer's and their wines. After all the picture taking, we finally made our way to the Calloway room. We began with some cocktails, wine and appetizers. I sipped on my fruity grapefruit concoction and munched on appetizers while  trying to pay sharp attention in the meeting. By the end of the meeting we were all happily warm and fuzzy inside. After the meeting we moved next door to the Board Room for our evening meal. The Capital Grille is known for their seafood and steaks. I ordered a 2lb boiled lobster with butter and a T-bone steak that was the special of the day. The lobster was already cut up and delicious with the butter. The steak I got was medium rare and really juicy. I also got the try numerous sides and appetizers like the oysters, spinach, lobster mac n cheese, truffle fries, etc. The food is absolutely delectable and I would love to come back to dine here again.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Mm this place was so cool! Everyone loved the food but it was also impeccably presented, which I find very pleasing and important in upscale places - it looked like it was very well prepared and garnished. Waiter service was decent but could have been more attentive - both for bringing the side dishes (potatoes and asparagus) for the steak on time and for routinely refilling the wine glasses. At one point the waiters were also carrying around two bottles of the same type of wine, so if you asked for the second type they didn't really have it on hand.. Overall the food, decor, and ambiance of this place was great, though. Would enjoy coming back here for something like a romantic meal. Went here for a corporate event though so can't speak for the price ;)",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Overall I enjoyed me experience here. I made an initial reservation for a more private room upstairs for business lunch. Thank god I did as it was a bit more quiet and we can actually here each other. We had a few bottles of wine, they have a nice diverse selection of wines. As an appetizer we tried the seafood cold platter. It was delicious, it had crabmeat, lobster, oysters, and shrimp. I was a bit unimpressed with the oysters though as they were tiny. Now to the steak; I tried the filet mignon medallions with the cooked onions (minus the mushrooms). The table decided to share some sides including mash potatoes, asparagus, and bell sprouts. Everything was cooked to order and delicious. Wrapped up with some chocolate cake and espresso and coffees. Overall everything was pretty good and we were taken good care of. Kudos for the sever that took care of us.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I have said this before on Yelp: I am a connoisseur of steakhouses. I have been to Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, The Palm, Keens, Delmonico's, Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille (TCG), Bobby Van's, Ben & Jack's, Uncle Jack's, Rothmann's, Gallaghers, the Bull & Bear (in the Waldorf), to BLT (in Washington, D.C.), to Shula's (in Indianapolis), and to Brumus in London (U.K.), (which is not a steakhouse, but the way they cook their cuts of meat--SO GOOD, they might as well be). Mostly in New York, often in Long Island, often in D.C., and as far away as London (indeed, I have even been to the top steakhouses in Dhaka, Bangladesh!); I have been to these places to eat, and savor, steak. Multiple, multiple times. Yes, I have never been to a Morton's, or to Sparks in Manhattan (even though I worked at the United Nations for years).  But outside of that, I have more experience . . . than most. Consistent with my past reviews, I think the only 5-star steakhouses are Smith & Wollensky and Peter Luger. Next are all the 4-star (excellent, beyond delicious, on their own) steakhouses: Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's. Next come the 3-star steakhouses, and I would put TCG in this category (though, just barely-it is not as good a steakhouse as Bobby Van's or Gallaghers). Mind you, if you are reading me for the first time, my view of a 3-star *steakhouse* is that it would be a 5-star restaurant in any other category. I think steakhouses like this are worth the big prices customers shell out (if you can't afford a top-line steakhouse, don't go to one; there are economy/chain steakhouses that do a similar, but nowhere near as amazing, job well enough for someone who can't spend more than $60 on diner for two-ish people; go to that if you have not got the money to spend on a top-line steakhouse). The 3-stars are the ones that are still worth the amazing price, and are great restaurants on a more absolute scale; they just aren't in the same league as those top-of-all-of-America steakhouses listed above (i.e., *relative* to the best-Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's--they are only 3-star steakhouses). So, *why* is TCG 3-star, neither more nor less? Well, in order to end on a positive note, let's start with the negative: The cuts of meat. They're not bad, and they're still very nice, expensive cuts. But, they are just a little less well cut, not perfectly cut, with not all the most flavorful meat, unlike better steakhouses. The cooking of the meat is not tip-top level too. If you ask for your steak rare, it can be cold in the middle (I think the staff has a philosophy that *that is* ""rare""; however, I just don't agree; other steakhouses have a ""rare"" level that does not have any coldness to it). It's been very long since I ordered steak rare instead of medium-rare, and if you ask for steak here medium rare, it is still pretty damn good. However, other steakhouses don't have this problem, and I think that needs to be counted against TCG. Another problem is the lobster. Again, it starts with what (under a kind of principle of charity I think we should hold when we write these reviews on Yelp) must be called a difference in cooking philosophy: TCG, basically, takes the whole lobster out of its shell, and brings it to your table easier to eat/ready to eat. I think that is the idea, and I am sure some people appreciate the avoidance of needing to crack, and otherwise deal with, lobster shell/s. But, it makes it more likely that the lobster is a little cold when it comes to you, and that makes it not go so well with the melted butter (insert here: horror, weeping). Well then, what saves the 3-star rating for TCG (in my book)? First, take the last two objections I listed above: Neither come from incompetence. They take the lobster out of the shell on purpose to *help* you, the customer. They cook meat REALLY rare, when you ask for ""rare"", because that is what they think the customer has asked for by saying ""rare."" They CAN make sure meat is more hot and cooked, and you CAN ask for the lobster to be left in its shell, and for you to be given tools to crack it open/eat it at your table. Indeed, what is said here by other reviewers about service I totally echo. The placing of this particular TCG in an old bank, using the vault the way they do in the decor, all makes it a very nice place to eat. That took loving care and attention to build, and the waiting staff are the same. They aim to please, and will do so, if you just understand that things like ""lobster"" and ""rare"" mean different things here than they do at other steakhouses. If you specify to the staff just what you want, they will give you amazing service to (largely) get it. (Though, the cuts of meat are still worse than at any other steakhouse, except the 2-star/1-star steakhouses. Not much worse than other 3-stars, but still worse.) Sides are great, including the creamed spinach. Overall, this is still a great restaurant.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

And typically I don't pay attention to calorie count associated with dishes, but took a peak and low and behold the chicken caesar salad had twice as many calories as any other salad and actually more calories than every fish entree! I wasn't totally sure why/how but that was the way it was. The cheese castle surrounding the chicken caesar salad was absolutely monstrous, delicious but a little overwhelming.

"When I go to Capital Grille, there are only two possible explanations: 1) A business event that I'm not paying for &  2) It's restaurant week. I find this restaurant to be far too expensive for what it is and I'd rather pay that price elsewhere (I'm not crazy enough about steak). This time, it was for the latter reason, and while I still think Capital Grille is overpriced, I appreciate that I can always get consistency in quality of food and service. There are no surprises on the menu - it's your classy old-school American steakhouse. We came in a group of 9 and were seated in a very nice private dining room. We started with two bottles of Argentinian Malbec ($40 each). I loved this wine, not only did it go well with the steak, but it was sweet enough that I could drink it alone. For my appetizer, I had the clam chowder. It was delicious! I loved the consistency and all the little pieces of shell-less clams inside the soup. For my main entree, I had a medium rare aged sirloin steak with arugula / mozzarella salad. The steak was already nicely chopped up but not yet mixed with the salad. The portion of meat is perfect for lunch but definitely smaller than a lot of the offerings on the menu, in particular the dinner menu. I thought the meat was pretty well-seasoned. I later asked for some steak sauce, which unfortunately is not made in-house, and I immediately regretted my decision because the sauce was just too overwhelming! The steak wasn't the most melt-in-my-mouth amazing steak of my life, but it was definitely above average quality. Finally, for dessert, I had the flourless expresso chocolate cake. By now, I've had enough wine, meat, bread, etc. to be in a food coma. Amazingly, the second I bit into that caffeine infused cake, I immediately started feeling awake again (crazy!). The flavors in the cake were great, but it was TOO DENSE in my opinion. I could barely eat a third of it. I ended up finishing my friend's creme brûlée, which tasted much superior in comparison. I still think Capital Grille is overpriced unless you come for Restaurant Week (or if someone else is paying), so try to come while the Restaurant Week deal is still going on!",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"I was very apprehensive about coming here (mostly because I never really enjoy steak), but alas thank goodness for Restaurant Week. It turned out to be a very unique and enjoyable experience-a pleasant surprise! Came here for Restaurant Week lunch with 8 other colleagues. We were seated in a private room with a large table and a door that could close, which was really nice. The decor is very old New York. I can definitely see why this place is a hot spot for business lunches. I ordered the clam chowder to start. It was fresh, hot and tasted like what I expected chowder to taste like, but not super memorable. For my main I chose the aged sirloin steak with the arugula/mozarella salad. I was actually very impressed by the steak: it was just the right level of chewiness and rareness. The outside edges were particularly well-seasoned and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the amount of meat. The inside could have used some more seasoning, but overall definitely among the better steak that I've had. For dessert, I finished with the chocolate espresso cake. It was extremely dense-I didn't end up finishing it, but helped to counteract the sleepiness that everything else induced. We also ordered two bottles of Malbec for the table, which were delicious. Their wine selection comes on a hip iPad-pretty cool/efficient. Service was also impeccable. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and in general very fast.

However, during this 15 minute time period, we were not informed that there was no steak left at a STEAKHOUSE except for the filet mignon. This, we thought, was quite dishonest. In the end, we did order food as it was late, and there were not many restaurants still open open around the area. I enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese - the crumbs complemented very well, and there was plenty of lobster inside. However, my s/o thought the chicken was slightly lacking (he did not order seafood as he is allergic) and the potatoes were not good.

One year ago my husband celebrated his big birthday with 20 guests at the CG, which by the way was flawless and extremely well executed down to the last detail. Throughout the year we became regulars and decided to also have his birthday dinner at CG again this year. Not a wise decision! We were so disappointed from the service, there simply was no service. Water glasses weren't filled up, I had to ask for a waiter to be able to place the order, get drinks and at the end ask for our check. During the entire dinner not one waiter would check on us. I have never had that kind of experience at the Capital Grille before. This was a special occasion, which I let them know beforehand. I also noted, that each table on the second floor had the same issue with service, one lady even had to get up to fetch a waiter in order to get the bill - it was not up to par. The food was pretty amazing as always, that is why I am giving it three stars and not just one.

"I planned my friend's 40th surprise birthday in one of the private rooms at the Capital Grille. I have to say in terms of value, the Capital Grille earns an A+. The planning process went smoothly, and they had a choice of menus to choose from. $85 per person got you 3 appetizers for the table, a choice of salad, choice of entree and a choice of dessert. They worked with me to choose a red and a white wine to serve at the dinner. Now, in fairness, the manager really did try everything to make it right. My months of planning came to an abrupt halt, when the hostess announced my last name to the birthday girl and ruined the surprise. I thought the instructions were pretty clear to use her dad's last name when seating her party. Beef tartare was supposed to be one of the three appetizers served. It never came, I asked about it and the waiter said ""good question"" and the manager came out to apologize. She asked if we wanted another appetizer, which we didn't (by now we had already eaten our salads). Food is good. It is exactly what you order, in a large portion, standard prepared. My steak then came out well done, instead of medium rare, so I didn't get to eat with the rest of the table.

"This is a classic expense account place.  Of course, the classic expense account is quickly becoming a thing of the past, but not this place.  There's a big open bar when you walk in, usually aswarm with business types.  If you want something quieter, ask for a table upstairs.  I work in the area - the service is always excellent, the food flawless, and if you happen to have some kind of issue, simply mention it - and they will fix it.  White tablecloths, big wine list, attentive service, at a price to match.  In today's market - full of fads, high staff turnover, celebrity chefs licensing their names to investors - that's something to celebrate.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"First off, don't go here if you're one a time schedule. We had reservations at 6 with a show at 8. I had read online that this was a preferred place that catered to people on their way to broadway shows. I checked in around 550 and was not sat until close to 640. Once sat, I asked our waitress for the theatre menu and we did not see her for another 20 minutes. Now, I will say this, she took our order at exactly 656. I told her that if I could have my food, enjoy it, and be out the door by 730 that I was going to leave. Not only did she fulfill that but she beat it by a minute. We walked out at 729. The food is amazing. We both had fire mignons with salads and creme brulee. I had the creamy spinach which I had once before at Peter Lugers and it was phenomenal there. Not here, tasted really bitter and tart. The mash potatoes were excellent though. Other then the horrendous wait time, we had a great dinner. I will gripe and say why take reservations if you're going to run so far behind. I wasn't the only one irritated in the lobby at this.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

The vault was a wonder to behold. the bad: 1) 1 appetizer per table (the first course). We ordered the shrimp cocktail--each person sampled one shrimp. 2) the main course, the steak, was gristly :(********* 3) even though we were supposed to have an open bar, the waiters were so slow in bringing us our orders so in two hours we only got two drinks. 4) one dessert dish per table.",2.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Came here on a business trip, was looking for a good steak to put me in a food coma and let me sleep off the jet lag.  Having been to the capitol grill in Washington DC, I figured this was the place. Started with the wedge, which was disappointing. It was lathered with dressing and did not have a lot of bacon or blue cheese crumbles. Additionally, I like fresh cracked pepper on my salads, but no offer to add pepper was made by our server. That's ok. I was In the mood for some seafood too so I had the sliced filet oscar. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare, nice warm red center, very tender, but it didn't have a lot of flavor. I asked for the Bernaise on the side, it was a perfect complement for The crab and asparagus. Also Ordered the mashed potatoes, which were super creamy and more asparagus, I didn't realize that my steak would come with asparagus, it would have been nice if the server had let me know, I would have ordered a different vegetable. Overall the food was pretty good and I would come here again, but when you are paying $100 for a meal, you expect more than ""pretty good"".",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"A selection by a friend brought us here for restaurant week & it was well worth it. This restaurant is a gem around Wall Street. The menu was very generous & had no supplements. Well only one & was completely reasonable. I ordered App - the wedge salad with bacon & blue cheese which was great. Entree - the porcini rubbed sliced tenderloin, cooked medium rare. It was too perfection. Very juicy with a hint of spices. Which was a great play for me cuz that's how I love my food. Down to the last bite it was delicious. We also ordered a side of lobster mac & cheese, and this is delectable. Self explanatory if your a seafood lover. Dessert - the creme brûlée, was a great end to my meal. The custard was delicious with a vanilla flavor & was very smooth. I couldn't wait to eAt. I left feeling completely full & satisfied. An excellent fine dining experience with great service. Our waitress Natasha was very attentive & friendly. She walked us through the menu & was very friendly. She even brought sample from the bar of a stoli drink, which was delicious.

"Splurged for my birthday dinner and it was well worth it. Service was excellent as you'd expect. My son had roasted chicken and loved it. My wife had the 10oz bone-in steak.  It was a little under-cooked for her taste but they quickly took care of that and brought over two complimentary sides to make amends. I had the special filet with lump crab meat on top.  I like my filet black and blue and this one was cooked perfectly.  Very tender and tasty.  The sides were fantastic.  We ordered the creamed spinach and potato au gratin. Both very very good, though my wife felt the au gratin to be a bit salty.  The complimentary sides were the spinach and mashed potatoes. All three of us pretty much agreed that they were the best mashed potatoes we ever had! It was expensive but, honestly, less than we were anticipating.

"Here's a secret ladies - there's nothing a nice steak dinner won't do to convince your boyfriend/husband/man to be on board for your weekend shopping trip, to finally get around to doing those chores, or simply planning a nice date night for you. Enter The Capital Grille - a manly steakhouse complete with deer heads, random pictures of old men, red velvet accents, and a giant steel vault door opening into the dining area. The restaurant exudes a wall street money/financial banker-esque vibe. Great for the occasional novelty atmosphere but as a woman - it wouldn't be my first choice to dine. Came here for restaurant week and it was a solid menu and a great value. The field green salad was more like a garden salad but the vinaigrette dressing was great. The clam chowder was delicious - highly recommend. It was smooth, creamy, but not too heavy. There was a good amount of clams and potatoes in the soup. For the main course - the bone in kona crusted dry aged sirloin (14oz) medium -  grilled perfectly - pink in the center and a good portion as well. The shallot butter was a nice touch but the slight bitterness of the coffee crust wasn't really my thing. Can't say it's the best steak that I've had - but it's still pretty good. The mashed potatoes were average - it was denser than other lighter/whipped versions I've had. The french green beans sauteed with the shallots and grape tomatoes however were delicious. Perfectly cooked and flavored. By now I'm in deep food coma but of course there is always room for dessert. The cheesecake was a lighter version. It had a nice sugar crust topping like a creme brulee but less flavorful than your normal cheesecake. Seemed to taste more like an egg tart - it was good but not what I was expecting. I'm a chocolate lover so this may be skewed but the flourless chocolate espresso cake was delicious. It was more of a dense dark chocolate fudge paired with light whipped cream and a raspberry drizzle. If you enjoy dark espresso chocolate - sweet but slightly bitter - you'll enjoy this dessert. Also if you like wine - this is the place for you. I don't think I've ever seen a more extensive wine menu. There were some decently priced bottles ~$30 along with the more lavish wines. Try the Bogle pinot noir if you prefer a lighter red - it was suggested by our waiter and I enjoyed it. Service was on point throughout the night. Our waiter was friendly, personable, and didn't treat us any differently even though we were ordering from the restaurant week menu. The restaurant manager also went around introducing himself and checking on the diners. Great attentive service.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

We had apps and sides of lobster crab cake (big chunks of meat!), truffle fries, cream corn (nothing special... stupid of me to order this), mozzarella basil tomatoes (very good).  For entrees, I had the Delmonico ribeye steak w aged 15-yr vinaigrette although incredibly good, I ordered med rare but got slightly overcooked. My wife went with the sesame encrusted seared Ahi Tuna - a huge steak of fish that was nicely cooked. We couldn't finish it so it made for a really good tuna salad the next day. We topped it off with a chocolate hazelnut layer cake - very good and very rich. Great bottle of wine, house blend of red smooth.

"Food was excellent and should deserve 5 stars but boy were we in for a surprise. A lunch reservation was made for a group of 17 people and it was ready for us when we arrived. Excellent. Our server started taking our drink orders and then 15 minutes after being seated.. our CFO pointed up and saw a HUGE (seriously) cockaroach/waterbug/creepy crawly (whatever it was) into the lighting fixture. It was crawling all over the inside of the fixture and we quickly told our server. It didn't look like it was going to come out of the fixture anytime soon, but just knowing that there was something above us while we eat was just unappetizing. The staff was very acknowledgeable and quickly assembled a new table for us, this time we were seated in the vault (talk about fine dining for lunch). ANYWAYS, back to the food... We came for Restaurant Week, and this was a really heavy lunch. The Parmesan Truffle Fries were excellent. The few of us who order salmon thought it was perfectly cooked. The green beens had a really nice dressing. I didn't get feedback for the sirloin or burger, but people who ordered it looked like they were enjoying it. We were way too stuffed to have dessert there, so we took the dessert to go. People who had cheesecake wanted more. I had the flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. I felt like I was just eating Fudge... a lot of fudge. But really good. Thank You for the wonderful lunch and additional guest!

"First off, service here is amazing. From the hostess, to the waitress, to the runners, everyone was super nice. Great at recommending things and very patient with our large group. The appetizers and sides were delicious! Lobster crab cake was awesome! It had large chunks of seafood, not much breading. Lobster mac and cheese is so good, I might have to come back for that! Creamed spinach and creamed corn was also delicious. I would definitely come back and sit at the bar, and order some sides and apps. It's a beautiful place! If you have a large party, you'll probably even get your own private room, like we did. Not packed at all on a Saturday night. However, this is a ""steakhouse"" first and their steak is not that good. My party ordered a bunch of different cuts, like the Kona, the Delmonco, the porterhouse, and the sliced filet. I had the Kona Bone in Sirloin with their coffee rub. At first, I can smell the coffee, but then afterwards, it just tasted bitter. The shallot butter was bland and the steak was overcooked. My husband had the Delmonico and he had a lot of fat in his steak. Don't come here just for steak... it's a good experience and the apps, sides, drinks, and service makes up for it.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"We took a client here expecting a lovely sit down lunch. What we had instead was a lovely incredibly long wait. DO NOT TAKE CLIENTS HERE, it makes you look bad. The service was atrocious. The staff, while very nice, disappeared for most of the meal. Besides the fact that it took an hour and a half just to get a salad, when we did get our food it was not prepared as we ordered it. This combined with the fact that it took ANOTHER 45 minutes after we had the salad to get our main courses, was ridiculous. We were all very hungry by the time we got our food and some of our table had to leave early which makes everyone look bad. Lunch took two and a half hours (this is NOT an exaggeration). The restaurant proceeded to only comp one meal, which was also ridiculous considering that they knew the service was bad and even came over to apologize. This is in a very large space, which was full. Typically kitchens can service the space of the restaurant but somewhere along the way Capital Grille never learned this lesson. The food was great but avoid unless you just want to kill three hours getting annoyed and waiting on food.",1.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

Originally I was worried that they couldn't accommodate last minute, but to my suprise, they allowed it and had such great phone manners. I ordered the wedge with bacon, he ordered the calm chowder for appetizer- we ended up switching. For the entrée I ordered the dry aged sirloin steak 14oz, he ordered the honey citrus glazed salmon, we ended up sharing and the salmon was the favorite for the night. For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee and he ordered the triple chocolate cake. These desserts were on both end of the spectrum, wayyyyy to bitter and wayyyyy too sweet. But, I would just like to point out that the atmosphere was great, the live band music was a great mood setter, and the quick and amazing employees allowed everything to run smoother.

"Heads up: I came here for lunch because of NYC Restaurant Week - guilty! The hosts at the front were very accommodating when it came to moving my lunch reservation by half an hour. For the appetizers, we had the choice of: 1. Wedge with bleu cheese and applewood smoked bacon 2. Clam chowder 3. Caesar salad For entrees, we had the choice of: 1. Dry aged sirloin with roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella, and arugula salad 2. The grille's signature cheeseburger with parmesan truffle fries 3. Seared citrus glazed salmon with French green beans 4. Caesar salad with all-natural chicken breast For dessert, we had the choice of: 1. Flourless chocolate espresso cake 2. Classic crème brûlée I first had the clam chowder - I thought that it was delicious and fresh to the end. I could have eaten bowls of their chowder and been okay with it. FYI: There's no meat in it, just clams. I then had the dry aged sirloin (medium well) and it was delicious!! Not too much to make you feel overwhelmed, but just enough to get you your money's worth. The arugula salad on the side was a perfect accompaniment for the steak. For dessert, I ordered the espresso chocolate cake and it was very good. My friend thought the espresso flavor was too strong, but to each his/her own! To my regret, I was too full to finish it... Our server Chris was great and I can't wait to eat here again! Cailin's Recommendations - Clam Chowder: not too creamy, just right ($10) - Dry Aged Steak: don't knock it until you've tried it - they're sliced up and surprisingly filling! (Bone-in 14 oz: $31) - Salmon: I almost got it, and I still almost wished I did (but steak wins every time because duh). My friend, however, ordered it - the salmon is always cooked medium - and she loved it! The meal looked so fresh, which is probably why she ended up cleaning her plate ($23) - Cheeseburger: that thing is HUGE!

"With restaurant week almost over and last minute reservations, Capital Grille easily accommodated a group of 8. On top of that, when running slightly late, I called to notify my tardiness to extend for another 10 minutes. They happily done so and when checked in my party was lead through one of their iconic pieces, the Vault Door. After a couple of steps past the door, much to my surprise we were welcomed by our waiter in a private room. My waiter, David Brown, did an excellent job at recommending wine, liquor and most importantly the choices of food. My friends decided to tell him it was my birthday, inquiring the complimentary dessert. We all ordered from the restaurant week menu with a bottle of his most recommended wine and five old fashions to start. I started off with the classic wedge while some of my friends had the clam chowder. The wedge is easily preparable so nothing to nitpick at. My friend complained about the chowder being too salty for her taste, but it tasted fine to me. Everyone's entree ended up being steak and it was cooked perfectly. Now onto the dessert...unfortunately, they ran out of creme brulee so David came by to inform us about the substitute of cheesecake or espresso cake. I chose the espresso cake and my complimentary birthday dessert was the cheesecake. Upon the dessert arriving, we were told due to the shortage of creme brulee we will be given a complimentary bottle of champagne. David had poured all of our glasses and he wished to take a photo of everyone for the special occasion. As he has done a wonderful job and he was one of the best waiters I had, I requested of him to be in the picture as well. He grabbed someone to quickly take a picture and shortly into my dessert, he arrived with the printed photo. Although dinner was perfect, I did find something slightly annoying. While I have not finished my old fashion, which was half full at the time, and dessert, my cocktail was taken away from me. I called David in to inform him and he quickly said he'll be able to take it off the bill if I wish. In the end I chose not to as it would have looked bad on his part. To sum up, I enjoyed the night very much and I thank David for having to put up with me as I'm sure I could be difficult to deal with.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Restaurant Week 2015 Dinner Review Capital Grille gets its right with RW menu! They provide a lot of choices and you will leave FULL. I picked this location because when I go to a Steakhouse I want the pomp and circumstance haha. Also, love the live jazz they play during dinner service. As for the menu: - Start you off with bread (comes out warm) - We all had the Wedge salad with bacon, tomatoes, and blue cheese dressing. Exactly what you expect and delicious. - Filet mignon was cooked to the temperature I liked (Medium rare plus...i know i know but Im learning to get to medium rare!) My friend ordered medium rare but it was closer to medium rare plus on the edges. - Dry aged sirloin was cooked well as per my friend - Creme brulee was what we expected as well but lets just say Gordon Ramsey wouldve expected a top that ""cracks"" a bit more. Still a solid dessert. Nice hints of vanilla. We also ordered the 2013 Greystone Cabernet Sauvignon as recommended by the sommelier. The provide a wine list via a tablet that recommends wines as well according to food pairing, type of wine, by the glass, etc. Obviously if you still have questions you can still request to speak with the somm. Well thought out. Great service!! Attentive, water refilled constantly, and offered recommendations when asked. Also, loved that the steak knives cut the steaks like butter. No sawing meat here.

"Wonderful experience, from start to finish.  The wait staff really makes you feel like a valued guest.  First time I was here, I came for the restaurant week promo in August and loved it.  They had a 3-course meal for $40 or $50, I believe.  I had the wedge salad, the salmon with green beans and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  The food was amazing and cooked just perfectly.  It was the best piece of salmon I had ever had- it was just a little crispy on the outside and delicious.  Second visit was just about a week ago.  My mother was in town and was visiting for the weekend.  I took her here and we split a salad to start. She ordered the filet and loved it, it was cooked just to her liking, and I had the salmon again.  We had the apple dessert with ice cream.  It was nothing special.  I would get a different dessert next time, but the rest of the meal was phenomenal.  We were celebrating a special occasion and the manager had a handwritten card on the table, along with some confetti.  The waitstaff is top notch.  Really nice restaurant for special occasions.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"I was disappointed with the food here. I came here with my mom for lunch and we got one Maine lobster salad and one restaurant week lunch, which included Clam Chowder soup, a sirloin salad and cheesecake. The soup was watery. The salads were both just okay. I had an AMAZING lobster salad at The Smith a few weeks ago--seriously, it is a must try--and the salad at the Capital Grille just did not even compare. The highlight was probably the cheesecake which had a yummy creme brulee topping. The ambiance is also upscale and nice. However,  I will not be back.",2.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
Have been on 2 occasions.  Both times i ordered the salmon salad with mango and avocado because it was soooo yummy the first time i couldn't get it out of my mind.  Obviously the cater to the wall street money crowd so the service is on point.  They'll even ask if you're in a rush at lunch and they offer to push the food thru quicker.  The second time i made a lunch reservation for my friend's birthday.  Unexpectedly they had confetti on the table with a card and gave us complimentary dessert.  The flourless chocolate espresso cake is amazing! Everyone enjoyed their food and everything i tasted was delicious.,4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"We had a great time at Capital Grille during Restaurant week. It was super easy to make a reservation through OpenTable. We got there and was promptly seated on the second floor, not too far from the live jazz trio, which plays every Friday night. The waitstaff was knowledgeable a friendly. The Restaurant Week menu was comprehensive (and available online). I ordered the Caesar salad, filet with shrimp and chocolate cake for dessert. The boy ordered the wedge with bacon and blue cheese, the sirloin and the creme brûlée. We also had sides of mashed and green beans. The apps were very good. Salads were well dressed. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The shrimp were large but over cooked just a tad, enough to make it slightly rubbery. Desserts were perfect - the creme brûlée rich and creamy and the chocolate cake nice and dense. The downside of the meal were the beans, which were overcooked and had a strange tang from the tomatoes. We may revisit Capital Grille and not just for Restaurant Week, though you definitely cannot beat such a great deal!",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Came here for restaurant week dinner with a group of friends, and there was not anything particular about this restaurant that  stood out to me. My friend chose this restaurant because the menu serves the sirloin steak that she wanted, however the night that we went the menu seem to have changed because the steak was not offer in the preset menu. My friends settle for the NY 14oz and I choose the tenderloin, and two other friends choose the salmon. The salmon was cooked very well, with a crispy outer layer and softness on the inside. Each entree comes with a side of mash potato or greens, and appetizer consist of two salad options, or clam chowder. Go for the clam chowder! Dessert was either a chocolate expresso coffee cake or creme brûlée. The creme brûlée did not disappoint, however the expresso cake was too chocolately for me that over masked the expresso flavor. We all ordered our steaks rare, and I thoroughly enjoyed my tenderloin. It was well season with flavor compared to the 14oz NY steak, however it was not as rare as I liked it to be, it was more towards medium rare. The service was mediocre, they had an iPad for a drink menu which kind of ruined the feel of the restaurant for me. Even though it was a modern upgrade, it didn't match the ambience of the restaurant and brought down the service level because it was hard waving down our server. Overall, the food experience was good and it was good time spent with good company.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Some of the best dry aged steak I've ever eaten!! The service is fast and incredibly friendly and for such a busy night, the ambience was quite low and the atmosphere nice and laid back. One of the nicest touches is an interactive iPad cocktail and wine menu where you can literally compare wines from flavor to body to acidity and more, and even email yourself a copy of the wine-label in case you don't want to forget. You can also see more information about certain wines, the steaks, the restaurant and dry aging rooms all on the iPad you're given, so it's almost impossible to have a question left unanswered. Overall, DELICIOUS food, and really sociable friendly service in particular. For a higher end restaurant that's serving steak that's better than Smith and Wollensky, the prices are very reasonable for what is offered.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Top notch food and service. I had made reservations the morning of, and ended up changing it 3 times throughout the day before our reservation came. We came here for restaurant week, but we ended up ordering from the regular menu instead. Our server was great, he was so funny and he tried his best to take care of us even when he had to deal with the other larger party who was being extremely difficult in his section. We had one half bottle of wine, two orders of the oysters (4 pc each), the porterhouse, seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tails, creamed corn with smoked bacon, and grilled asparagus with lemon oil to share between 3 hungry girls. I thought the food was amazing. Everything that was brought out to the table, we enjoyed. The only problem of the night was that the seared tenderloin were a bit on the rare side when we asked for it to be medium rare, but other than that, everything was great.

Lobster salad was artistically presented and as fresh as it can get, steaks cooked to perfection. The restaurant is impeccably clean and tastefully decorated.

"I took about 15 employees here for a holiday dinner with a $2500+ bill. The food was excellent, everyone was happy, the special tomahawk steaks were huge, the special African lobster tails were gigantic. The service had some issues described below. This could have been five stars if these service issues did not happen. We ordered a few sea food platters immediately but it took a very long time for them to show up, especially considering they are raw. Maybe they took all the drink orders first, but we did ask for the platters almost immediately and before the drinks. They should have put them in, then took 15 drink orders. They double poured the second bottle of wine(it was different) right away causing multiple people to have double glasses of red. They should have asked each person if they were ready for another glass. This happened before any food arrived, maybe just bread. They cleared the sea food platters when they still had lobster and maybe other good stuff on them without asking or wrapping it up! That is lobster! I thought they were trying to save space and would bring back the left overs on smaller plates for the table, but they threw them away. There was a long wait between the appetizers(which came after removing the sea food platters) and the steaks. We did order over 10 steaks so understandable. They spilled steak sauce on one of our employees. She went to the bathroom to wash her shirt off and made sure I knew it happened and said they said sorry but really didn't seem to care. I thought I was clear when I asked to wrap up my left over steak and my wife's seafood in the same bag but the seafood was in the same container as my steak which she wasn't happy about. I also asked for the sides (minus one veggie I don't enjoy) to be packed with my steaks but did not get any of the left over sides. So they heard half of my request and messed it up. At $2500+ I expected better service but overall everyone enjoyed their food and had a good time. In my humble opinion the steaks were not as good as Wolfangs and Peter Luger's, but on par with Gallagers, Delmonicos, Bobby Van's and better then Mortons, STK or Ruth Chris.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

We were laughing our asses off, and it was never too much. * Desserts were especially good. The standard huge portions, and a nice variety. The bad: * Think our waitress was spread a bit thin. The food came out very slowly and she had a lot of tables. * Kitchen consistently screwed up. The brussel sprouts were wildly undercooked, we got 1 order of potatoes instead of two. Sparkling rosé instead of rosé. * Steak was overcooked to hell and back. Medium came back well-done, medium-rare came back medium-well.

Best service and management of most steak chains. Have been here often but they are one of the few restaurants that put a great menu together for restaurant week.

My preference is definitely to sit at the bar but the place is huge so plenty of comfy tables and booths.  I've seen this place get PACKED around 12:30-ish, and seems to empty out closer to 2:30 ... and more so (hiccup...) by 4:30.  Check, please!  Would recommend reservations in general.

"Over the past 4 years, I have been to the Capital Grille (Wall Street location) for lunch or (more frequently) for dinner over a dozen times.  To say that I've never had a bad meal here would be an understatement - rather, it would be more appropriate to say that I've always had an excellent meal here. The food is amazing - I usually get the Filet Mignon or one of the other Steak dishes for my main (it is a steakhouse, after all)... they are always perfectly prepared and properly cooked as requested.  Some of the other highlights / personal favorites include the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, Parmesan Truffle Fries, and Caesar Salad.  The wine list is quite extensive, with a good range of different price points.  Save room for dessert though - the crème brûlée is great... and the cheesecake (with just a slight brûlée topping) is fantastic, not to be missed! Service is outstanding - the wait staff here are top-notch, friendly, and go out of their way in order to ensure you have a wonderful dining experience.  In all the times I've been here, the service is consistently high-quality. Last but not least, the atmosphere and ambiance is superb.  With the way the restaurant is set up / arranged, decorated, and lighted, the entire establishment just has a very classy and old-school vibe about it, which I love. What more can I say?  Yes it's expensive, but so worth it.

"My friend took me here for my first meal when I arrived in NYC (so this is a bit of a belated review). Service was a little spotty when we first got to the restaurant. We did not have a reservation but it was late for lunch, so the restaurant wasn't crowded... However, it took the host a while to sit us though there were a lot of tables available. The food made up for it though! We shared the pan-fried calamari with hot cherry peppers appetizer. I've always loved fried calamari but the Capital Grille took it up a notch! It was a huge serving and we probably ate too much of this for our own waistline's good... The calamari was crisp and had a fiery flavor thanks to the hot cherry peppers, but was not too overwhelming. For my entrée, I wanted something light and chose the seared Chilean sea bass with sake braised mushrooms and miso butter. The fish was cooked perfectly - it flaked away easily with the touch of my fork. We were both really full at this point but my friend raved about the flourless chocolate espresso cake, so I succumbed and we shared this. We were really lucky to get the last piece of the afternoon! And it surely did not disappoint! Very rich, but balanced perfectly by the fresh raspberries.

"We've now been here on two occasions. The first being a Generous Pour event held for residents of our building. When we first walked in, we were amazed by how large it was inside and how nice the decor was. It felt like what you would expect a typical place for a Wall St crowd to have dinner at. From the outside, it doesn't look like much because of all the scaffolding, but the decor was really nice. For this event, we were served hors d'oeuvres that were much larger and better quality than I have seen for hors d'oeuvres.They had scallops, strips of filet mignon, lamb popsicles, mushrooms with balsamic vinegar on baguette slices, bruschetta, lobster and crab cakes, as well as copious amounts of cheese. The food kept coming out of the kitchen, which was really impressive - usually at events like these, they stop the food pretty early on. They had seven different wines to taste - 4 red and 3 white and they kept serving until they ran out. We really enjoyed the event and hope there will be another like it soon! The second time we came to Capital Grille, we tried out the RW Menu because of the good price for steak. We weren't extremely hungry that night so we thought one of us would order the RW Menu and the other would order something from the regular menu, and then we would share everything. After looking at the prices on the menu, we decided on an appetizer - the lobster and crab cakes. The lobster and crab cakes at Capital Grille are really good and taste very fresh - the combination of the lobster/crab makes it very flavourful. For the RW Menu, there weren't many good choices for the appetizer I felt. I can't eat raw vegetables and 2 out of 3 were salads. The other option was clam chowder and I can't eat clams. So my boyfriend ordered the wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon. It was quite large - the bacon was good! Then we ordered the filet mignon which was very juicy, but a little undercooked. We asked for medium and it was more on the rare side. For dessert we had creme brulee which wasn't that exciting. We would be back, but it is very overpriced on a regular day.

"I've eaten at the downtown Capital Grille a few times now and once at one in Long Island, I've yet to have a disappointing experience here. On my most recent visit we had some time before the rest of the group showed up so my girlfriend and I enjoyed a few cocktails at the bar. I tried the Blackberry Bourbon Sidecar, and she had the Stoli Doli. Both drinks were good and neither tasted too strong, but after finishing our first drink we could definitely tell they both packed a punch. For appetizers we had the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with tomatoes, oysters, and the pan fried calamari. All three were huge hits with the table, I'm not a big seafood eater myself but I was told the oysters tasted fresh and delicious, and the plate of calamari was picked clean. I did have the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella and it was very delicious, the cheese was nice and fresh with a creamy texture and it went well with the toasted baguette slices. As an entree I had the Kona crusted bone in New York strip steak and it was fantastic. Surprisingly the coffee doesn't give off a strong flavor or aroma, you can definitely tell there's something different about the steak and it has a beautiful crust, but you wouldn't immediately think ""Oh that's ground coffee"" (except one piece near the bone where you could tell the steak didn't touch the cooking surface and wasn't crusted.) My girlfriend ordered a bone in New York strip from the restaurant week menu but that one was not coated in the coffee grounds and you could definitely tell the difference between the two. Like most New York steakhouses the steaks were cooked right to the desired level of doneness (it's as if they've cooked a steak or two before...), which I've seen many typical restaurants struggle with. Everyone ended up ordering mashed potatoes as a side so I didn't have anything else to compare that to but they were smooth and creamy just like I like them. For dessert I had the flourless espresso chocolate cake, if you love rich chocolate dessers than this is the right dish for you. It's served over a raspberry sauce with a small dollop of whipped cream on the side and paired with a cappuccino it's the perfect way to end the meal. TL;DR I've eaten at a number of steakhouses in the city now and when you eat at enough of them you begin to realize it's just more of the same only in a different environment. If you've never been to a real steakhouse before then this will be one of the best steaks you've had in your life. If you're looking for a great steak in the area then you can't go wrong here. If you're looking for the BEST steak in NYC then I can't help you, there's no consensus on the best. Everyone seems to have their own answer, some people say Peter Luger's, I prefer Del Frisco's, but in the end it all comes down to personal preference. What I can say is that on a typical night you won't be disappointed here.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The food was amazing at the Wall Street (NYC) outlet of this steakhouse.  We had a party of 8 and they sat us in a private room off of the bar.  The service was impeccable and super-attentive.  We ordered a couple of bottle of Hornig Cab.  It set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Half the dinner party ordered beef, the other seafood.  Not one complaint from anyone. For my starter, I ordered the the lump crab cocktail.  Large chunks of tender, juicy chilled crabmeat served with Capital Grille's signature creamy cocktail sauce.  Regrettably, it went down too quickly.  For my main, I ordered Chilean Sea Bass in Mushroom Soy Broth.  Seafood at a steakhouse is second to none.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  It was flaky and broke apart easily with a fork.  There was a nice sear on top.  The broth was amazing.  It was worthy enough of being served on its own.  There was actual mushrooms in it, not just flavor of mushroom. One of my dining companions order the Seared Ahi Tuna.  I was jealous. I had the opportunity to taste it.  This piece of sushi grade fish was perfectly seared on top and rare throughout.  It was delicious.  I wanted to order one of those to take home, and almost did.  I looked around the table and saw everyone's steak was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and tender.  Dry-aging at its best. The sides were equally amazing. We ordered brussel sprouts roasted with bacon, the lobster mac and cheese, truffle fries, creamed corn, and mashed potatoes.  The lobster mac and cheese was awesome.  Creamy without being gloppy.  Chunks of tender lobster finished off with panko.  The brussel sprouts were perfectly roasted and not charred like you get at other places. My recommendation, the Ahi Tuna, lobster mac and cheese, and send me an invite.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Amazed every time!! You can't go wrong dining at this classy establishment. The staff is great- friendly and helpful. They always know their stuff. I have had several of their steaks and filet mignon- they are all cooked precisely the way you specify. If you're ordering sides, get the lobster mac and cheese, it's the best side I've had. Choosing your wine and filtering by region or type on the iPad provided is simple, modern and even a little fun. Last time I was there I got a bottle of the Herman Wiemer.  If you like cocktails, the mojito is classic, and the hunt of grape gives it a sweet edge.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
Start off with the positives. Came here for an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. Informed the restaurant ahead of time and when we arrived there were small heart shaped decorations on the table with an anniversary card on the table. During dinner we were given two free glasses of champagne. The service was good. The ambiance is lovely. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese to share as an appetizer. It was very soupy and salty. We were very excited for it and we didn't even eat a quarter of it. I ordered the porterhouse dry rub steak medium well. The steak was cooked great however it was very lacking in flavor. I was really tempted to ask for A1 sauce. I would try it again because of its reputation but I would not order the same thing twice.,3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Had lunch here during the restaurant week with much expectation but all I got was the worst ever. Each course cannot be rated as a four-star restaurant. Poor taste, rough decoration,slow service flow. Would never come here again !",1.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I'm not a big fan of steak house in general because steaks are really easy to make. You can spend the same amount of money, pick out a really nicely dry aged steak from a local high quality butcher or whole food and grill/cook it at home. Steakhouse sometimes prepare their steaks beforehand and I'd feel so disappointed that my steak was dry and overcooked. Capital Grill is really big inside with two levels of seating area. I went for a Tuesday lunch and both levels were fully seated. Perhaps it was because of the restaurant week. I have to say RW lunch is a really good deal. You get a three course meal which usually costs a lot more. However, out of my clam chowder, dry aged steak, and creme brulee, I really only enjoyed the chowder. I think it is up to Pacific Northwest standard, which is a high compliment for a chowder found in new york city. Steak was okay, under seasoned though. Center was medium rare I asked, but the surface was too dry. I think it was cooked beforehand and then heated up for service. I like my steak tender and juicy. Creme brulee also felt like it was prepared long beforehand. The caramel on the top was soft and does not come as one whole hard and hot piece that covers the cream filling underneath. The caramel top tastes just like raw sugar particles sprinkled on the top. The cream though, was pretty tasty and featured with rich sesame flavor. I completed my chowder and wanted more, but did not finish my steak or the dessert, as I wasn't particular hungry and could prepare them better myself. Oh, the complimentary bread was pretty delicious.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I have been to many a Capital Grille, and maybe that's why despite living down the block from this one since it opened, I've never been.  The manager sent us a gift certificate recently to ""try it out,"" so I figured why not?  The food is standard (and wonderful) Capital Grille fare, but what sets this location apart is the giant and beautiful vault in the basement (I'm sure this building used to be a bank like everything else around) and the live jazz on friday nights.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"The Boyfriend and I came here with a large group of 10 and they gave us a very private room sectioned off from the rest of the crowd. We were seated right away and give both the Restaurant Week and regular menus. Their wine list is extensive! The Wall Street location doesn't charge an extra supplement for their Bone-In Kona Sirloin, which is a huge plus in my books. I came here planning on ordering that particular dish so not having to pay extra was amazing. Our waiter comped our bottle of wine since they ran out of the original two we ordered and they also ran out of creme brulees. The Bone-In Kona Sirloin is heavenly - it is definitely in my top 5 steaks in NYC. It was cooked to just the right temperature and tasted amazing. The sides were also very good as well - my favorite was the mashed potatoes. They were so creamy and buttery!",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Two recent visits resulted in overall positive experiences with some uneven service. Appetizers included Pan-Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers & a standard Shrimp Cocktail. The hot peppers provided a perfect ""kick"" to the calamari dish which was shared and enjoyed by everyone. However the house-made cocktail sauce included with the large five piece Shrimp was a bit too strong. On one visit we decided on a fish entree. The Chilean Sea Bass with Mushroom Soy Broth was a somewhat satisfying choice. The fish was perfectly cooked yet was lacking taste as the broth was bland. The other visit resulted in a Filet Mignon - on the bone - special. Ordered medium the steak arrived medium well but was enjoyed regardless. Looks are a bit deceiving. Upon arrival the steak size was impressive - when completed you realize the bone size is impressive. All sides (asparagus / creamed spinach / mashed potatoes) did not disappoint. The desserts shine here. The Cheesecake with Fresh Seasonal Berries was moist, light and incredibly tasteful. A highlight which must be ordered. The size of the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake will intimidate you. You love chocolate - this is for you but be prepared to share. Service on our first visit was fine however some oddities during our second. One soup appetizer arrived - it was quite some time before the remaining three appetizers were received. This resulted in ""cold soup"" for one. While eating our appetizers here came the entrees. The server noticed our surprise and quickly existed taking the ""early entrees"" with him. Unacceptable for an establishment of this kind. Also - at times - we were somewhat forgotten as it was a challenge requesting a second glass of wine. The restaurant itself is very comfortable. Seated for three (3) hours we were never rushed. With its dark wood interiors Capital Grille screams ""New York Steakhouse"".",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Been here last month for my friend's birthday. Fancy restaurant, magnificent food, only ""good"" steak, and ""good"" service-- what else to expect? I enjoyed the complimentary quarter sized Asian pear (if I remembered correctly) appetizer, not too sweet, yet extremely delicious. I had a Delmonico steak, medium, with the mushroom dry rub. Not the best steak I've ever had but it was good. My favorites of the night were probably the lump crabmeat and jumbo cocktail shrimp, superb for appetizers. We brought a birthday cake to them to surprise our birthday guy and it literally took the waitress around 20 minutes to bring out the already prepared cake.....

"So the couple times I have been here I have had ENTIRELY different experiences. The first time was for a graduation lunch, during which both the service and food was impeccable. However, another time I went the service took very long and my filet was overcooked and FULL of fat. They did end up cooking another one for me to take home, but at that point it was just very upsetting that I had to wait a long time for my food and then it wasn't good.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Really great steak. I got the filet Mignon and my girlfriend got the sea bass- both were great choices. The steak was cooked perfectly. Flawless. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is that if you care about what you are eating calorie wise the menu is a bit sparse. Because Capital Grill is a chain they have to post calorie counts on the menu, which makes some choices like the lobster mac and cheese seem less appealing (over 1500 calories). However, there are still some choices that are reasonable and it is oh so good. Also I presume most other comparable restaurants are equally unhealthy but you never know because they don't have to post nutrition information on the menu. If you book with savored.com at certain times you can also get up to 25% off, which is a nice bonus. Overall a bit pricey, but it is reasonable when you consider the quality of the food. A note on the dress code- most people are in business clothes (for dinner) and some have jackets. It is by no means required, as I had on jeans and a tee-shirt and was fine.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Went here during restaurant week with friends. We had the $38 pre fixe menu for dinner. The atmosphere was fun, and we spent a good three hours there having dinner, though one of the reasons why we stayed so long was because the service was a bit slow. I suspect because it was a Friday during restaurant week, and the wait staff was taxed. I'm giving 4 stars because one of the managers took notice that our service was extremely slow (30 minutes just to flag a waitress down, 30 minutes to bring us our drinks, and 40 minutes for our entrees [some of which were wrong]) and she not only comped 4 of our 6 drinks, she gave us free calamari and gave each one of us a $50 Capital Grille voucher to use in the future. She didn't have to go out of her way to make us feel taken care of, but she did. As far as the food, I had the sirloin (I wish they had a rib-eye on their restaurant week menu). It was decent, as were the appetizers and drinks. I'll probably go there again, because a $50 Capital Grille voucher is asking to be used.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
Met up with Kitt today for a quick bite in the city and decided to pop into CG for a quick bite- yes we are pimps.

"This was my second time at this chain but this was a different location. Steak is their speciality and it definitely shows. The bread and butter came right away and they both were warm and easy to eat and keep eating. For the wine, they bring you an iPad to scroll through and browse at all their wine selections that they offer. We had a nice bottle of red for $50. We started with the wedge salad and it had a little too much dressing on it so next time I would get it on the side so I can control it. My date and I split the ribeye and it was PLENTY for both of us (they split it onto separate plates for you). The steak was tender and juicy just like the last time I ordered it. We got a side of creamed spinach as well as garlic mashed potatoes. Both very large portions, could feed sides for at least 4 people, I'd say. The mashed potatoes had big chunks of garlic cloves so make sure you like garlic! As usual the service was great with extremely happy-to-be-there servers. The only bad thing was that we didn't actually get our wine until we finished our salads. ALSO, they closed at 10pm which I thought was extremely strange and annoying since we had an 8pm reservation and wanted to relax and enjoy the wine and food.

"It was a rainy day but it did not dampen my craving for a burger.  I was in the area for a meeting so I ducked into Capital Grille at around 4 p.m. I knew what  I wanted and of course in addition to a burger nothing cries truffle fries than the sound of rain outside.  I sipped my pinot noir while I waited.  Perhaps I really looked starving as they also gave me bread which, to my delight, was piping hot. Not long after, my burger arrived and it was cooked a bit rarer than I preferred but it was fine by me.  The waitstaff, before I can say anything, immediately sent the burger back and replaced it with a new one., this time cooked to perfection.  It was exactly what I wanted.  And the lady who served our table can't be any sweeter. I would have given 5 stars but one of the hostesses kept removing chairs from the table and dropped my stuff on the floor.  I guess I did not expect that at a place where one pays $20 for a burger. :)  Yes, go ahead, judge me, I can really be cranky.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"What I liked.. was the clam chowder and the mashed potato side. The steak would have been good if it weren't too burnt on the top and bottom. I should also stick to medium rare cuz medium was a bit too cooked, especially with the smokey top and bottom.. That caused to not be that juicy or delicious. I am also sure their creme brulee would be an amazing dessert for some, but it is always a hit or miss for me with it. It was good and I did enjoy it.. However, my teeth started to hurt a bit as I was eating it. The dessert itself was not overly sweet but it was also because of my sensitive tooth that I could not enjoy this dessert as a whole. I did come in for restaurant week so it was a good deal. The items on the menu are not cheap! The restaurant itself is on a more classy-fancy side. Note, it is the financial district so there are business people with their business attire here, but don't worry, they welcome guests with casual clothing as well! Service is professional. The restaurant also gets busy! Expect a wait time, but no worries because it won't take too long.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Capital Grille serves up ridiculously good indulgent dishes alongside impeccable service. My waitress, Haidy, elevated the experience to the next level. I was seated and made comfortable while waiting for my date and had the chance to peruse the menus and the drinks on an iPad, which I'd never seen before. The mojito I ordered was spot on. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was the wine selection. I would have liked to see a Barolo and some more Spanish reds available. Still, I ended up with a Malbec that I enjoyed. We started the meal off with fried calamari. I recommend asking for a side of marinara sauce which they prepare fresh and adds a nice kick to the calamari, which also arrive atop some sauteed peppers. Haidy helped my date and I navigate the menu and pointed us towards the rib eye steak on the menu; they call it the Delmonico. The steak was massive but it was flavored to perfection. We also enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese and the filet mignon. There were  mostly business dinners taking place around us, but the restaurant was a great choice for a date.

"Resturant Week: 3.8 stars. App: Ordered the Field Greens and claim chowder. Field greens was just salad with no dressing, it was okay.  Claim chowder tasted very good with a good amount of claims in it. Main: Bone in Kona and Glazed Salmon. Steak was cooked medium with a pink center, tastes awesome when dipped in the buttery sauce on the bottom.  Salmon was a bit dry, and really just seared, there wasn't much taste to it.  Good thing it came with two sides; cream of spinach and mash the taste of these two sides made up for the lack of flavor in the salmon.  The salmon didn't seem to be seasoned well enough.  Was just a piece of glazed fish on top of asparagus. Dessert: Flourless chocolate cake and creme brulee.  The cake was so rich and heavy, but too bitter.  Tasted like a heavy melted dark chocolate bar.  Creme Brulee was too sweet, but had good consistency. Service was a bit slow at time, but friday night..must've been busy.  Live band was playing.  But once they stopped, the whole place was filled with white noise from people talking; they should put some house music if the band stops playing...sometimes it felt awkward when they stopped playing music.

"Restaurant Week Menu Review. Will post up regular review later. Pros: Great Steaks. Filet was super soft, and the sirloin was good. We asked for rare and it was perfectly cooked. The attentive service is what you expect from a Wall Street steak joint. Classy decor. The cheesecake was wonderful as well, with a slight crust on top and pie crust bottom. The ""generous pour"" is a deal worth getting. It's $25 for 7 pours of different wines, 3 whites and 4 reds (each pour about 3/4 of a standard pour). Good deal. Cons: The two steaks up for selection in the RW menu aren't as flavorful as what they can do. For example, their Delmonico and the porterhouse are so much more superior than the RW steaks. But I think that is the point of it all. For appetizer, we got the field greens. It is what it is hah. Bottom line: Always a great restaurant, and the RW menu is quite good.

I was expecting a solid classic steakhouse dinner and that is exactly what we got plus a lot more. The service (Ryan) was fantastic. And they have one of the best wine programs I have experienced going on now through early September. ""Generous Pours"" is their wine event where the sommelier has selected 9 choice wines for you to pick from to enjoy along with your meal. The servers help pair the options with what you are eating. The choices are nicely balanced between sparkling wine to start followed by a few white choices (including a new to the US market selection from Slovakia), followed by several red choices and ending with dessert (ice) wine. This took our already delicious steak dinner completely to the next level.

"I've been to 6 different Capital Grille locations (used to live next door to one in uptown Charlotte) and enjoy the consistency in quality and service. The last one I'd been to was the Charlotte location a while back, and I remember after about 4 years I noticed for the first time a slight drop in ambience and overall quality. However, this was not the case in other cities, and I finally tried a Capital Grille in NYC in the financial district. It was a wonderful meal. We started with the shrimp cocktail followed by tomato and mozzarella and spinach salads. The jumbo shrimp were quite jumbo and beautiful. The tomato and mozzarella were not my dish but very much enjoyed. I loved the spinach salad, it could of had just a tad less dressing though. Main courses were both Chef's specialties- sliced filet with mushrooms and the filet with lobster tails. Both were delicious and cooked PERFECTLY. I've been having a few disappointing issues at reputable NYC steak houses regarding meat temperature, but not here. I expect fantastic steaks from this establishment, but these were so far above and beyond. The server paired us well with lovely wine selections. It was also nice to see their famed coffee rubbed sirloin on the menu...it made me a bit nostalgic as I recalled that dish back in my hometown on many occasions. For desert we had cheesecake and berries and cream. The cheesecake is essentially 2 desserts in one. A huge piece of cheesecake as well as a beautiful assortment of fresh berries. I had the berries and cream. Again, beautiful assortment of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries with homemade vanilla bean cream. You could see tons of vanilla beans in the cream.

"A great steakhouse that does all the little things right. We had a reservation for a party of 13 for a Thursday night.  The place was filled but not overly crowded.  As I was the last to get there, I let the front know we were here --- they offered to transfer the bar tabs to the table; standard but a nice touch regardless. We hadn't requested it, but got a nice sized private room for our dinner.  One wall had the giant glass window that faced out into the street.  It was really nice ambiance. Servers (yes, it was a small team of folks) were all really nice, very patient.  I liked how the main server took the women's orders first --- a classy gesture. Food came out quickly.  The tomato and basil salad was better than the Caesar. A couple of folks noted the steaks were just a bit undercooked.  I requested mine medium but it was more a medium-rare; another friend asked for medium rare and his was noticeably closer to rare.  The meat itself was tender, a tad under seasoned but overall pretty solid.  The desserts might've been the best part.  The flour less chocolate espresso cake was great, and the cheesecake (with this super-thin sugar topping a la creme brûlée) was even better. So it's not the best steak I've ever had (and given that this is a chain, with a calorie count on the menu and everything - thanks Bloomberg - I wasn't expecting it to be), but it's a really nice dining atmosphere and a solid place for steak and ambiance.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

I was there for a Yelp! event and they did it up right. There was delicious shellfish bar, a meat station, cheese and crackers, dessert bar and lots of wine. I like this place and I'm definitely going back. A little about the food. The lamb - to die for and buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The tenderloin - so tender you could rip it with your fingers or cut it with a butter knife. It's just so good. The shellfish (lobster, crab meat, shrimp) was all delicious.

"First stop for RW summer 2012. I didn't realize capital grill is a high end chain steakhouse.. I always try to avoid chain but I am surprise that Capital Grille is pretty good. Many restaurant shrink their portion during restaurant week but not at Capital Grille. I took off one star because I have better steak at Club A Steakhouse but I don't wanna compare too much so I will just give my review on the food that I ordered. Start of with a salad, well is just a salad. I am not gonna talk much about it. Entree.. Ordered medium well filet mignon. The temperature was perfect as 4 of us at the table ordered our steak in different temperature. The waiter make sure that he explain how the steak is gonna be before placing our order. The mash potato wasn't that great and the spinach was ok. Dessert, espresso cake & creme brûlée are both amazing. The espresso cake is really rich with chocolate. So chocolate lovers out there, you will like it. Love it?? I think it's slightly too thick but is still good. Overall.. I think 3.5 stars but they deserves .5 star because of the service.",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"A Financial District classic and a favorite among my old coworkers and I. Despite being an upscale restaurant in an uptight area, the service was always extremely friendly and accommodating -- we often received free calamari appetizers and sometimes even champagne or dessert because we went there so often. Our favorites were always the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster salad, but everything on the menu is absolute fantastic. Just don't come here if you're looking for a cheap lunch! Also, no matter what, definitely try their signature Stoli Doli! It's absolutely delicious.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Came here during Restaurant Week with 5 other friends, and we're all so glad we picked The Capital Grille. Appetizers: We all got Clam Chowder. Decent. All of us ordered different things; M and I ordered Fillet Mignon, A,C, and P ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter, and B ordered the Parmesan and Herb Marinated Tournedos. All were very good. Everyone said the fillet melted in your mouth. The sirloin was great. But the one that stole the show was the Tournedos. They were perfectly seasoned and very light. Compared to our heavy steaks, the Tournedos were just the opposite, and was the best one at our entire table. A and I heard that the Lobster Mac n Cheese was amazing here, and A couldn't take it anymore, so he just broke down and got one. Great decision because IT TASTED AMAZINGGG. Creamy, slightly cheesy, noodles were perfect consistency, and lobster bits were big. Dessert: M, P,  and I got the Chef's seasonal Fruit Sorbet, B and C got the Crème Brûlée, and A got the Flourless Chocolate cake. The sorbet was a perfect end to a heavy dinner. It was Pineapple and Coconut, and the coconut was so creamy and light, while the pineapple was the perfect amount of tart. The Crème Brûlée was also good, but it could've been burned a little more. The cake was really heavy and thick, kind of weird-tasting to me. Service was amazing! Georges(Pronounced George) was a great waiter, and made all of us feel appreciated. Teenagers often get bad service because we're in that awkward stage; Not quite adults, and not quite kids. I don't think I've ever been treated with such respect before. Will definitely come back and get the Lobster Mac n Cheese again!",4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"I came for lunch during Restaurant Week and I have to say, after reading other reviews I was very disappointed in my experience. Maybe it was because we came at the tail end of the lunch service (was seated at about 1:45), but service was extremely slow and getting our server's attention was near impossible; our salads were nothing spectacular (My Caesar salad was underdressed and had two croutons. Two.); the steak was under seasoned and we weren't given actual steak knives until we were almost done with them; the arugula salad was overdressed with stringy bits of roasted pepper; and, despite having ordered the flourless chocolate espresso cake at the beginning of the meal, we were informed 50 minutes later that they wouldn't be cooled in time to be served for our dessert. I was on my lunch break and only had an hour (I've eaten at other restaurants during restaurant week in the financial district on my lunch break, never had an issue getting in and out quickly before), so we boxed the rest of our entrees and got the desserts (creme brulee) to go. I have to say the creme brulee tasted good, but I wish I had been able to share it with my boyfriend instead of eating it at my desk. The only other positive of the experience was the bread and butter that came at the beginning of the meal: The butter was wonderfully soft and therefore easy to spread, and I'm a sucker for that. The lunch special of three courses for $25 is still a good deal, and I feel lucky that we only paid that much. I know that restaurants like this one aren't making much money on these restaurant week lunch specials, and maybe we just were here on an off day -- but nothing about this experience would make me want to return, and certainly not if I had to pay their normal prices.",2.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"To start the picture the restaurant ambiance was very nice and it wasn't busy. We were sat upstairs at a big round table that sat 6 of us.

"Here is a secret tip for you:  if you are looking to eat an upscale steakhouse on a weekend and don't want to have to make the reservation weeks in advance at some packed, noisy midtown steak-nuthouse, well the Capital Grille in the Financial District is the place for you. I came here with my wife on a Saturday night for an excellent steakhouse experience, minus the tourists and the bachelor parties.  The Capital Grille Wall Street is like their other locations: it is big, has lots of wood, comfy booths, soft lighting, etc.  The difference here is that Wall Street is empty on weekends and this place was about 30% full on our visit (they are absolutely SLAMMED during the week). We sauntered in, a bit  late for our reservation, were greeted warmly, brought to the dining room upstairs, and were able to pick the booth we wanted.  Fantastic so far.  Our waiter arrived soon after, and walked us through the specials, etc and was very pleasant.  Sometimes when a restaurant is slow, the waiter acts ambivalent, or worse, ignores you while watching the TV in the bar.  Not so, here.  Our waiter was excellent.  He took time to chat us up, answer my wife's litany of questions and make some recommendations on wine.  The service was indeed excellent. The steaks were amazing as usual, cooked perfectly to order.  I had the filet and my wife had the filet oscar.  We each had a glass of red wine and finished it all off with Strawberries Capital Grille. We walked out of there beaming, with smiles ear to ear.  I am looking forward to coming back again.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I went to Capital Grille for Restaurant week and I was more than satisfied with my restaurant experience!!!!  When I first walked in, the ambiance was nice and classy, like a typical wall street steakhouse with portraits of old people.  I ordered clam chowder for my appetizer, the Bone-In Kona Sirloin steak, and the flour-less espresso chocolate cake.  The steak was extremely juicy and flavorful.  If you know how to order a steak at a classy steakhouse, request it to be cooked ""Medium"" or ""Medium Rare"" (pink to red in the center).  The chocolate cake was made with rich dark chocolate. If you're a chocolate lover, you will fall in love with this cake.  I also tried my friend's Creme Brulee and I loved it even more than the chocolate cake.  Eating a creme brulee is enjoyable after eating a heavy meal because it's very light and sweet. Capital Grille also has a huge wine cellar for wine fanatics.  I hope you take advantage of restaurant week and have FUN! =)",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I dined at this location on New Year's Eve, thinking a classy and upscale venue would be a safe bet for a nice, quiet and relaxing evening. Boy was I wrong. Our party was seated directly in between two tables with small children making a constant cacophony of high-pitched noise for at least 20 minutes. After about 10 minutes, I approached the maître d' and asked that he speak to the parents at each of the tables and ask them to keep the noise level down. He simply said that it would put him in an awkward position, since The Capital Grille had brilliantly decided to provide New Year's Eve noisemakers to various tables (including (or perhaps exclusively?) to those with children). I suggested that he could politely ask them to keep the noise down until closer to midnight (it was only 8 p.m. at this point), but he did not budge and was almost dismissive. Another member of our party then spoke to him for several minutes, but to no avail. While the parents clearly deserve the first line of blame for their extremely poorly-behaved children, the maître d' has a responsibility to ensure the decorum of the restaurant, as well as satisfaction of all guests. Not only did he fail in this regard, but he neglected to offer any conciliatory gestures like complimentary appetizers or drinks, discounts off the final bill, etc. This would have made the evening more enjoyable (and most likely negate the motivation for this harsh review). We were eventually seated at another table once space was made available, but the mood of the evening had largely soured by that point. I'm rating the venue more than one star because the server and the food were both fantastic. However, the experience we had that night when paying top-dollar was completely unacceptable. The food at The Capital Grille is quite expensive on a normal night and seemed to be considerably more expensive for new year's eve. On any other night (or if the situation had been handled more professionally), I would probably have rated the restaurants four or five stars, but I will not be coming back. Rather unfortunate for The Capital Grille that a simple change in behavior (or a nice gesture) by management would have led to repeat business, as well as our recommendations to many friends and colleagues.",2.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"So I have been to two other capital grilles in the city and this one is pretty much exactly the same. The food is good, the calories are on the menu and the wine is not in any way cheap. What really stood this restaurant apart was the service - and not in a good way. We had to wait in the little hallway for our table for an amazingly long time (we had been at the bar for a couple of drinks and were shown to the hallway before eventually being taken to our table.) It was like they had forgotten to set up the table before coming to get us. Our waiter was definitely not happy to be a waiter. Which is a valid thought process, but probably better kept to oneself. Our table had leaves that were held up with bars, but two leaves were broken, so sloped downwards as an alarming angle. We asked to be moved, but were told that there were no other tables (I could see plenty). So instead, the waiter crawled underneath the table and fixed the two leaves...by sticking two table knives in them! It was quite a show for the other diners, but we weren't expecting (or particularly excited) to be the entertainment! Moving us would have been so much simpler. The food was ok, not good enough to make up for the weird knife display, although I have to say that the parmesan truffle fries were absolutely incredible. Really, I would have happily eaten two portions and not had the steak! So there we are. If I ever go back, I am going to quietly let the hostess know that I'm not accepting any shenanigans with broken tables.

"Great pick for quality and value during Restaurant Week. They give sizable portions for the lunch menu. The waiter boasted about how Capital Grille was the ""best value for Restaurant Week"" and he may not be completely biased. You can't go to Capital Grille without trying their steak. I highly recommend the sirloin (medium) which comes with a well-seasoned salad. The salmon option was less impressive (simple, as expected). Appetizers were solid, but pretty standard (I got the clam chowder). For dessert,  the flour-less espresso chocolate cake was quite decadent, something worth leaving room for. Compared to other locations, the ambiance of this location is great for groups (seating upstairs), especially for the professional crowd at lunch. Service was attentive.

"Today I was definitely given a special treat. When my law firm takes us out for Secretary's Day, they go ALL OUT. Last year we went to the Bridge Café. Which is absolutely lovely and divine and 'the oldest bar/restaurant' in the city. However, they are still closed due to Sandy. I was eager they opted for something new and different and not Cabana Nuevo in the Seaport. Hooray. I am all for old-timey steakhouses! Capital Grille is actually a chain. A very good steakhouse chain. Coincidently there's one near where I used to live in Michigan at Somerset Mall. Moving on, we ended up getting reservations in one of their private rooms in the basement. The room was closed off with solid oak doors and had William Howard Taft raising his eyebrow over us on a gigantic square table. I could get used to this. For my salad appetizer I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella, Basil and Tomato with 15-year aged Balsamic Vinegar. Holy crap. That Balsamic was divine. I've never had any better tasting in my life and put on to such a simple and delicate dish I got to savor and enjoy every bite. We were also greeted at the beginning with warm dinner rolls and a cracker like flat bread. For my entrée I ordered the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. Normally, I'm a freak and get my steak done well. However, this time I opted for just Medium. Not even Medium-well because I knew that I could not destroy a perfectly good $40 steak with being a pussy. Every bite was savored, trust me. I almost wish I asked for medium rare I enjoyed it so much. The mushrooms and onions with the steak juices were truly mouth-watering. In comparison to other steaks? I give it a 4.5 out of 5. Tribeca Grill's was honestly a tiny bit better. Though I only had pieces of their filet appetizers for a separate corporate event. And Peter Luger's anything is still King in my opinion. But a fine fine steak indeed this was. We also ordered a bunch of sides, family style for the entire table. The only thing we freaked out about and joked about are the calories listed on the side of each dish. Whatever. I thought the Parmesan Truffle Fries were better than the Shoestring fries. Though, other people felt differently. Shoestring fries are so basic. The other ones are of a thicker cut and not crispy but not soggy either and have that decadent truffle oil and better seasonings in my opinion. We also ordered the asparagus and French beans with shallots and heirloom tomatoes. The heirloom tomatoes definitely popped in your mouth with the beans. The grilled asparagus was good but not memorable. Something that could be replicated even at home on the grill. It just made the meal more well-rounded. The staff was phenomenal. Checking on us for any needs at just the right moments. By this time we were too stuffed for desert. But everything sounded delicious on their menu. Chocolate Hazlenut cake and the flourless chocolate espresso cake sound delish. Also, if I were to come here again they have a Lobster and Crab Burger. And I'm sure they make a mean half-pound of lobster with butter. Food coma. Secretary's Day a rounding success. Go team go.

Let me start this off with by god, this place is absolutely astounding.  As I said- it really caters to Wall Street in that there is a huge vault door (y'know, the type you've seen in movies) that leads downstairs.  Everything is dimly lit (which you'd think is ironic because this restaurant makes so much money they could have brighter lighting..haha) but it really sets the mood for something relaxing.  Paintings everywhere, mostly portraits of famous people and landscapes of faraway lands... Burgundy seems to be the color I remember most from this place- very regal. It's very good for groups as most seating downstairs actually has a large table and a door that closes for ultimate privacy.  And of course, the walls are adorned with more paintings.

The wait staff was very friendly but not up to par.  At no point in a meal should this though cross my mind ""ok I think it is about time I got up and walked over to the bar to get my drink"".  Really!??  I ordered a beer when I sat down and reminded multiple wait staffs at least three times before finally getting my beer at the end of the appetizers.  I had to sit there refraining myself from eating my last few bites because my beer had not arrived yet.  You asked me who did I order my beer from?  Well I ordered it at least once from every waiter/waitress that has come over to our table.. does that help?  Just bring me a beer and don't ask me if I want it in a glass.  Bring me a glass and then I will let you know if do not wish you to pour the beer into it. Right when we sat down the servers were a little slow.  I blame it on poor training and lack of experience.  Our party staggered in over the course of half an hour and at no point were we offered to see the cocktail menu.  It was only until half way through our appetizers when I asked if they had any signature cocktails that they ask me if I would like to see there cocktail menu.  Why... yes, yes I would.   Where was this an hour ago when I really wanted to see it.  As others looked on.. woah cocktail menu.. where did that come from... yea my thoughts exactly. Onto the food: ******* The best bites of the meal were the Wagyu beef carpaccio and surprisingly the stoli doli.  A signature drink of theirs, that is a pineapple vodka infused martini. ******* The other appetizers were good as well but nothing spectacular.  Cant go wrong with fried calamari especially if it has banana peppers in it.  But if your going to get only one appetizer its gotta be the wagyu beef.  Melted in my mouth yum. Supper thin. Great taste and it will not take up any of that prime real-estate in your stomach. Now choosing what steak to get was a very had decision.  So many great sounding steaks, I ended up going with the dry aged porter house.  I fell in love with this cut of meat a few months ago so I figured this was a great choice especially since I don't go to steak houses too often.  The meat itself was great quality.  The grill marks on it perfect and it was cooked to the perfect temperature.   However, It was a  boring dish and the cut was thin.  If memory serves me right it was about 3/4 of an inch thick.  I will have to do some research at the butcher to re calibrate in my mind how big a 24 once steak is. But I could have sworn this cut was short a few ounces. When the waiter presented me with my steak I thought to myself... ""thats its?  Thats my steak?""  I was a little worried as I was picturing a much bigger juicier looking steak.  But no, it was most certainly my porterhouse sitting there all alone on the plate.  If the cut of meat would have been impressive I would not have minded it being the only thing on the plate. This steak defiantly needed something els on the plate with it to pull together its presentation.  The steak all alone just was not cutting it. NOW, when the Porcini rubbed Delmonico Came rolling out after mine steak I almost cried.  This was a really good looking steak.  If I come back here this is the steak I will be ordering.  Or maybe the kona crusted sirloin. I was fortunate enough for somebody to offer me up some of their Delmonico.  However, they had ordered it well done and this should be a sin.  I do not have a review of this steak.  Well done.. for shame!",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
First you can find a place to sit at the bar and they have purse hooks with good service.  We had lovely wine by the glass and a snack.  Went on to the dinner and we had no main dishes but a series of appetizers and sides and the service was great.  Exactly the right pacing and attention.  Very safe selection for a comfortable dinner where you can have a conversation with your guests.,4.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"One of the best steaks I've ever had. Took one of my friends there for lunch. Our only complaint is that they were a little heavy handed on the sadly but that can easily be corrected. Had the t bone medium rare and they executed it flawlessly minus the same. Friend had the filet mignon and he loved it. The crab cake appetizer was slightly burned but easily overlooked. Had the cream corn and the mashed potatoes, absolutely delicious.

"So this place is super pricey, that is why myself and some friends decided to go there for Restaurant Week. The decor itself is worth a visit. That being said this was the best meal I have ever had in my life!!! With the Restaurant Week menu you get 3 courses. I started out with the clam chowder which was very good and actually contained clam, I am told that some chowders don't?? (confused expression +shoulder shrug) I then had the bone-in Kona steak which was the most well seasoned steak I have ever had (and I have had the filet mignon at Cipriani's). I order it medium well and it actually came medium well, most restaurants for some reason think medium well= well done. It was perfectly cooked, just a little pink inside. It was also a sizable steak if I do say so myself. If I could have kissed the cook I def would have. We also had mashed potatoes and creamed spinach- mashed potatoes were ok, creamed spinach was TO DIE FOR!!!. They put some special ingredient in it (I think it might have been coconut milk) that made me want to lick the plate it was so good, and trust me I'm not usually a creamed spinach fan. Last but not least I had the creme brulee which was excellent. I should also add that I have had creme brulee before at a French restaurant on restaurant row and hated it, I guess it just has to be made well. It was perfectly browned on top (not burnt) and just sweet enough- I'm drooling just thinking about it. My friends had the flourless chocolate cake and said it was really good. I would def suggest this place to anyone :-)",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Capital Grille is a pretty standard steakhouse. Their menu has a list of appetizers and steaks followed by two pages of wines. At $50 a plate for the steak, it's pushing the boundary where it's hard to tell whether paying that much means that the steak tastes that much better. I feel what you're really paying for is the service as the waiter was always very prompt with taking our order and filling our drinks. However, I felt that the food arrived really slow. While I wasn't in much of a hurry, dinner still took 2 hours. I may be used to other steakhouses, but I also expected my steak entree to come with more than just a slab of meat. The lack of decoration with sides really made my dinner just seem like a thick chunk of oily meat. Dessert is a flat $9 regardless of what dessert you order. Not all desserts are made equal. A tiny fruit sorbet is the same price as a massive chocolate hazelnut cake (1310 calories) that two people will even struggle to finish. Overall, I'd categorize my experience as mediocre.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"I visited during Restaurant week back in early March which I thought was very good value. I chose the Caesar salad, filet mignon with creamed potatoes and the cheesecake for desert. I asked for my steak to be well done, which turned out a little too well done, as the edges were quite burnt - obviously not too pleasant but I didn't complain as i guess it was technically ""well done"". The creamed potatoes were divine and the customer service was excellent.  My friend had all different options, including the medalion entree and espresso chocolate desert and was very impressed also.

"Pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Came here with a large party (17+) for a birthday. The venue itself is fancy schmancy without being pretentious. We got us a private room which was set up quite nicely and offered somewhat of an upscaled, classic look and feel. It lacked the veteran's charm of Luger's, but still provided a nice ambiance. The menu is as expected for a steakhouse. The quality of the food was good, but I would not say outstanding. Items are appropriately priced for the atmosphere and the portion sizes, but flavor is a bit lacking. Dishes that one can use to gauge vs. other restaurants are the calamari and creamed spinach. -Calamari- tasted fine, but I've had better at standard Chinese buffets. The presentation is where a steakhouse should dominate, but the dish looked thrown together. -Creamed Spinach- Relatively thin (as in dilute), so it was not so filling. Here again, the flavor was nothing to write home about. -Steak-  I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico. The quality of the meat was high, as expected. Even when I ordered it ""Medium-Well-Plus"" (it broke my heart not to order it well done), the meat was tender and juicy. Flavor here was very good, but not enough to make me want to eat it again. Where this restaurant excels is in its service. The servers were knowledgeable, efficient and courteous. They made the ever-so-difficult decision making process much easier, and made appropriate recommendations. The only downside was that they were quick to remove dishes without asking whether or not we were done. Another area of dominance is the wine collection. It is ginormous. +1 service +1 extensive wine selection +1 venue +0.5 food 3.5 stars rounded down. Glad I came, but I'd much rather go to Luger's or Keen's.",3.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Restaurant week for lunch a few weeks ago. Came with a foodie buddie and we selected very different meals. We both enjoyed the bread, then I opted for the clam chowder while he got something else. Chowda was good, although easily construed as too heavy. I went little more than halfway (including the obligatory bread dip) before realizing I would not be able to enjoy soup & a dry-aged sirloin. Being the meat eater, I opted for the rare sirloin while my health conscientious friend got the salmon. Both were delicious! Mine in that dry-rubbed, tender, rare/pink way and his had the savory, juicy, salmony but not fishy flavor! My plate didn't look that big, but was pleasantly surprised to have 5 pieces to take home (lightly heated it up the next day, absolutely delicious!) We both got the rich & hearty expresso cake but were too full to eat it all. I thought about doggy-bagging this as well, but had my steak to tide me over.. They were pretty good about bringing food out, but add in getting there/walking back, waiter service, paying...I still ended up taking an hour & a half lunch, on a Wednesday. Definitely give yourself some time to get to where you need to. PS. Our waitress was nice, and very prompt in bringing (and refilling) our waters!

"If I had to describe this place, I'd say it is a well-oiled machine. There are pros and cons that come along with that; for the pros - super fast service and food that comes out exactly as ordered. The cons would be that there are probably about 60 people working on any given shift and the floor feels like Grand Central station during rush hour. We had barely sat down and the waiter asked for our drink order -- I appreciate the attentiveness but the feeling there is almost borderline rushed. I would imagine this fast pace would be ideal for those on time-sensitive business lunches - the pace would be a bit less necessary for a leisurely weekend dinner. That being said, the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the flourless chocolate cake was delicious. The caesar salad looked like something you'd get at Olive Garden - romaine plopped on a plate with bottled dressing/canned cheese on top. I'd at least expect some fresh pieces of parmesan at that price.

Service was awesome -our waiter was on point and food came out quickly.  Since the old goat likes to pretend he's my husband and knows I hate being bossed around, he ordered everything and didn't even give me a choice to contest his order.  He ordered the lobster / crab cakes to start, the sesame seared tuna for me (rare) and the burger for himself.  Oh, and can't forget the infamous Parmesan fries.  All were excellent choices; crab cakes were moist and flavorful, tuna fresh and the perfect temperature and fries were obviously awesome.

"3.5 stars. Was in here last week for a business dinner- Lower Manhattan - Financial District location convenient from the Path Train after a long day in corp HQ in JC. Extremely crowded walking in....met my guys at the bar, we got seated about 20 mins after our reservation time...to say that the front of the house was in a state of controlled chaos would be an understatement. Luckily we were seated on the 2nd floor well above the fray. Chair I sat in was broken so I found one that wasn't. Server said he knew there was a broken chair...well get it fixed or get rid of it I'm thinking... Filet sliders and calamari were great starters - calamari had a nice spicy kick. Double Lamb chops are excellent but doused in a cranberry sweet sauce even though it was requested without. Filet mignon was a good cut, tender and juicy. But what is up with the calorie count listed for each item?? What FUN is that? Really if I wanted all that info I would ask....way too much info for my liking. So I stuck with spinach and mushrooms sides....wanted the lobster and mac but the menu told me that was more than 2000 calories alone... Had to skip dessert too...again the in your face guilt of the calorie count really did take the fun out of it for me.

The creamed spinach and mashed potatos appetizer were very very good.  We both ordered steaks, I had mine rare and it was literally cooked to perfection.  It's one of those times where it's so good you shouldn't add any condiments because it's perfect.  They didn't have the Malbec we wanted to try so he gave us our favorite Malbec (Cantena 2010) for the same low price....we didn't mind at all. After observing our waiter, I made small talk with him and it really was because he's stressed because everyone's coming in for restaurant week and he's running around.  He even apologized for giving us an attitude so it's all good.

Steak was cooked perfectly even though the sauce wasn't that good. It masked the flavor of the steak. Creamed corn and lobster mac & cheese was amazing!!! Definitely my favorite. Food = 4.5 Service on the other hand was not even close to being acceptable. My boyfriend and I were sharing a steak and we had ordered appetizers. The waiter told us to reuse our appetizer plates for the steak. Seriously, what kind of restaurant are we in? He also did not take away our finished plates or drinks or anything else on our table. One of the ""busgirls"" had to do it. She also changed our plates and cleared everything for us. Waiter also did not show for a while even though he was helping others.

"If you're looking for an enjoyable wine and dine experience this summer, I strongly suggest taking a look at ""The Generous Pour Summer Wine Event"" going on at The Capital Grille restaurant July 9 through September 2.  I recently went to one of the launch events championing Master Sommelier, George Miliotes' summer wine selections and left excited about all of his choices.  The wine event at Capital Grille is a nine selection pour and begins with a sparkling rose` from Italy, Lunetta Rose` that manages to be both light and refreshing and gives a wink and a nod to the superb choices that will follow. There are two white wines being offered, an ""Orange Wine"" from Slovenia, and a 2009 Gary Farrell California Chardonnay that is both refreshing and mildly buttery.  Both excellent wines in my opinion. Miliotes is slightly more generous with his red wine choices and allows three Cabernet Sauvignons to make his select list.  My favorite of the Cab trio was a 2009 French Bordeaux from Chateau Du Pin that had remarkably smooth tannins and seemed particularly light for a full-bodied wine.  The Pour includes lighter reds too- one of which is a 2007 California Pinot Noir from Villa Mt. Eden's Grand Reserve that is extremely delicate and explodes with an abundance of fruit flavors.  Your final pour will be a sweet South African dessert wine, (Kanu Kia-Ora, Noble Late Harvest, 2006) that boasts a golden yellow color and intense flavors of honey. The Capital Grille is a multilevel restaurant that has a beautiful horseshoe-shaped bar as its centerpiece.  It seems cavernous at first glance, but somehow it still manages to offer intimate dining alcoves on all floor levels.  ""The Generous Pour"" can be had for just $25 per person with dinner, so go and enjoy a mix of some of the best old and new world wines around.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Passing this place every day on my way to work for the last few years, I decided to try it for the first time during restaurant week. We had made a reservation and when arrived, were PROMPTLY seated. While we were both dressed in business attire, we were not in formal attire, but were still welcomed with open arms.  The decor is that commonly seen in many steakhouses with dark walls and oil paintings with big fancy looking frames. For an appetizer I had the cup of New England clam chowder which was delicious with lots of clams and not too salty as many places would usually make it.  My wifey had the Caesar salad which was prepared stunningly with a big piece of shaved Parmesan cheese on top.  Nice touch! For the entree, we both had the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin; medium-rare.  While the 'crust' is made with coffee, cocoa, and mustard seeds, you can't actually taste any of the individual flavors, just pure seasoned goodness.  The roasted half an onion on the plate is a great idea for an edible garnish.   The only thing left on my plate when done was the meatless bone.  It was very difficult to resist the urge to pick up the bone and gnaw off all remaining meat (in the crevices), but I did want to remain proper in such a classy place. The sides included in the promotion were both good.   I choose ""Sam's Mashed Potatoes"" which were VERY creamy, but still had little potato lumps (which I really really like), and wifey got the creamed spinach which was good as well. It would have been nice if they were permit both sides for this promotion so as you didn't have to choose between a starch or vegetable, but the meal was quite filling as is currently served. For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  I could care less it was flourless, but rather just wanted (and got) that rich chocolaty goodness.  It was in cake format, but tasted more like rich dark chocolate mousse.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"Taking advantage of Restaurant week... A Salad, Filet Mignon, a Lobster Tail, and Dessert for $45? Yes please. I have found that sometimes restaurants become rude when you order off the restaurant week menu, or the meat selections are not up to par, but not here. Our server was Haidy, and she was amazing. She was very knowledgable about the menu, and wine, and she checked on us just enough, but not too much. If you can, get seated in her section. My food was great. I've dined here once before, not during restaurant week, and while our bill was much higher then, we had the same great experience. Service and quality is everything.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille
"I recently came to this amazing Steakhouse with my boyfriend for our 9 monthaversary (yes, that is a thing) celebration, and it happened to be Restaurant Week so we chose off of that menu. The food and the service was simply impeccable - I had the 8 oz. filet mignon, and the field greens salad as a started, boo had the 14 oz. bone-in Kona steak with the clam chowder as his appetizer. The steaks were cooked PERFECTLY, and with our sides of perfectly creamed spinach as well as our delicious smashed potatoes (I say ""smashed"" because they had the skins still on when they were mashed), it was a perfect meal. We were almost TOO full even for dessert, but of course had to get that (its restaurant week!)! I had the flourless chocolate cake, he has the creme brulee - both were simply divine, with the creme brulee not overly sweet and with the barest coating of burnt sugar on top, the flourless chocolate cake rich but with some air bubbles within the cake to keep it lighter than simply being thick mousse. We had a half bottle of chardonney with the meal, and our waiter was adorable and extremely attentive. The only, and I mean ONLY downside to this meal is that he seemed to be new so it took him awhile to get us the check, but he was extremely gracious and the other waitstaff was extremely accommodating throughout. The best thing about this place is that the combination of being a great deal for the RW menu, AND the fact that the service is simply phenomenal. Everyone was so sweet and polite, and didn't bat an eye if you said you were there for RW, which won them serious praise in my book. For that alone, I want to come here when it's not RW, just because of the great experience I had then! :D",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

"Last night was my 2nd time coming here for restaurant week and it was definitely worth coming back for! I came here this time with 13 other people, although my steak was perfect to my liking, unfortunately the friends I had dinner was didn't have the same experiences. 2 of their steak was extremely burnt to the bone and meat. We had to send it back for a re-fire. They were very accommodating and extremely nice about it. I had the Bone in Kona sirloin both times and it was delicious !!! I think it was definitely a good pick over the filet mignon. The dessert I had the Creme Brulee, although it was a little too sweet, but it was definitely delicious !  The mash potatoes were spot on as well! At the end of the dinner, our waiter offered us their signature drink,  stoli doli, Vodka infused with pineapple, a way to finish the night! The service was a little hit and miss through out the night but it was bearable. Just wish they offered us spoons before serving us the dessert, that way my friend's ice cream and sorbet didn't melt....the sorbet was extremely sweet btw.",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

Made for a very special evening. Our server Kevin was attentive and helpful too, from recommending good wine to discussing the pro's of bikram yoga.  The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, and there was so much of it!  Thank god the calorie counts weren't on the RW menu...pass the creamed spinach.  My favorite dish was dessert: strawberry ice cream paired with the flour-less cake.  Will definitely be going back on a Friday to sit a little bit closer to the jazz!!",5.0,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271",The Capital Grille

I started with the lobster and crab cakes which are soooo good!!! I wish they were larger. It's $22 for two, but they're not too big.

We were nervous it would've been soggy! -NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream:  DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT ENJOY BLACK PEPPER. The steak was perfect. The cream was a great pairing. It was like butter. Goodness, that steak was amazing. -Coconut cream pie:  There's a reason this is the most reviewed dessert here. Just get it. It is divine. I can't describe it any other way.  The BEST thing I've tasted ever. -Flourless chocolate cake: I'm a sucker for flourless chocolate cake because of the composition. It was dense, rich and chocolatey.  Fantastic. -Italian cheesecake: I love cheesecake, this was no different but it lost me with the ginger crust. -Stoli doli: Potent, but tastes stronger after the sweets?

"Mildly pleased! So they are a chain and huge and this location has a LOT of tables. The decor seems fancy but weird sofas at the booths. Anyway! We were first seated at a table right outside the kitchen door and beside a table (like a kiddie table). People were walking past us with empty and full trays, dropping things, chatting etc. THAT SHOULD NOT BE A TABLE. For such an establishment why have that thing over there and just turn off your guests. The good part is they sat us somewhere else when I asked to. Otherwise I would have walked out. They have a signature drink called doli soli- highly recommended if you like the subtle taste of pineapple. Their breads were good, especially the onion bread. I was disappointed with the Parmesan truffle fries :( The field green salad was nice and so was the French green beans with tomatoes. Very nice flavors! I got the filet mignon, and asked for medium rare,but it was more rare than medium. I liked it anyway so did not complain. But it's a steakhouse people, get the steaks right. For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake but they got a Creme brûlée by mistake but gave it to us on the house (nice gesture). Both desserts were very nice. Some things were off! We did not order wine but nobody took away the wine glasses (until much later). This isn't a big deal I know, but for a fancy place I expect it. This seems to be a fav for tourists. I guess I'll keep away for this in the future. It was a nice meal but probably wouldn't go back as it did not impress me enough!",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"3.5 for service with a smile and a nice convo, pretty attentive but personality was definitely refreshing. In terms of food it honestly wasn't anything special which was a bit disappointing but this is why i normally do not go to steak houses. Went for restaurant week with my bf he was craving steak lol and the interior is nice, romantic, cool structure as we were towards the front and outside of the kitchen area so only issue was it was cold by the windows. Started with the clam chowder which i should have known would be a small portion but it was nice a creamy definitely what i needed on a cold af day. Onto the mains sirloin steak, filet mignon 8oz and sides of mash potatoes and green beans and tomatos. The steaks were cooked to medium rare which was great but honestly needed some more pepper or something to make it more flavorful. As someone who cooks steak at home obvi i am sure they just have better cuts and still season well but maybe i am used to more seasoning and flavors than just a salt and pepper rub with maybe some garlic and butter. Even though these portions were also small to be expected it was a decent amt of food but probably because they make you wait in between courses as well. Sides presented in a shallow dish which was sad since we actually liked the sides plus it only came with like 2 tomatoes literally... Creme brulee to finish off the meal was good just enough sweetness. Definitely would not have liked the fudge option as the waiter suggested that it was pretty heavy and dense while we asked for recommendations. Overally not bad but nothing great.

"While in New York for Thanksgiving I had to have a traditional turkey dinner on Thanksgiving day, so we decided on The Capital Grille.  A lot of the other local places were already booked so there you go. The service was good, the food was also good and overall we had a great time here.  The only thing that did happen was one of the servers serving us spilled an entire glass of water on my leg, so I was drenched for the remainder of my meal, which moved this review to 4 stars. The manager did make it up and brought us complimentary appetizers and bought me another Stella on the house.  The bottom line is that Capital Grille always great food, but at a pricey cost.  Be prepared to pay New York prices for your drinks, and of course the Thanksgiving meal per person was up there.  We also have Capital Grille here in Dallas and we've had a great experience here as well.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Been to this Capital Grille location a couple of times, and generally have had very good experiences. As with all of their locations, their steaks are top notch, and their French onion soup is second to none. I particularly enjoy the Kona strip, however you really can't go wrong with any of their cuts. Other appetizers I've enjoyed are the wedge salad and the calamari. This is also in my opinion the coolest location, the dining area with the architectural glass ceiling looks amazing both inside and out. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I went here for restaurant week a few years ago and it was legitimately awful. The waiter made us feel uncomfortable for asking for the RW menu, and our steaks were incredibly underdone. I always order my steak rare, but this steak was so raw I was worried it was going to moo when I cut into it. The center of the steak felt like an ice cube. Then the waiter was no where to be seen for a long time, so I just ate the somewhat cooked parts and left it at that. Aside from that one experience, I've found that the service here is phenomenal and goes beyond your expectations even for an expensive restaurant. Even with a crowded steakhouse market in this part of manhattan, I still find myself going back here and will continue to.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

Huge delicious app.  Caesar salad very good.  Def needed pepper.  Double lobster tail and a surf and turf for mains.  Both delicious.  Side of haricot verts.  Such an enjoyable meal.  Such a sweet server.  Runners also friendly.  Glad we ate here.

"Such an interesting experience. I treated my beloved staff to a dinner here to close out the year. For me, this is by far the best Capital Grille in terms of ambiance I've visited. It's decor is modern and sleek, and is a little more in tune with my taste. Our server,Michael was so friendly and engaging. The food held up to the phenomenal experience I've had in other locations. However, I will note this, and it saddens me to do so. My party consisted of minorities. There was a middle aged, Caucasian, blond, curly haired female dressed in black that specifically approached us about our experience in a criticizing manner and immediately addressed the servers in our area while glaring at us. She was definitely an employee. There were four other parties I noticed, all Caucasian, in our area that she did not bother to speak to. She did not come back to check on the other tables which seemed off. Also, our original server was Terrance. Why he didn't follow through with attending us that night was not revealed, but he definitely served the other tables surrounding us-those that arrived after us. You can cut it up any way you want, but I know discrimination- I've lived through it, and I really did not appreciate it AT ALL. Worse off, my staff felt it, and I really wanted them to enjoy the evening. As much as I love the architecture and appreciated Michaels service, I do not think I will patronize this location in the future. An establishment that makes anyone feel inferior is reprehensible in every facet you can view it.

I always look forward going to the Capital Grille whenever I am near one. This is my first visit to the 42nd St location in New York. Reservation made via Opentable and when I arrived my table was ready. My server greeted me with my last name and was attentive throughout the evening. Oysters on the half shell and jumbo shrimps started the experience and were served fresh on ice. Oysters were good size and cut already. Shrimps were large and tender. Lobster Bisque was on the menu that evening and was delightful. Entree was a fantastic medium rare 10 oz Filet Mignon accompanied by mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. My server suggested half orders for the sides which was definitely a good idea seen the full portion size is usually good for two. Wines selected were a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and a Napa Cabernet Sauvignon ordered by the glass which were both great pairings with the food.

Firstly, the restaurant's interior provided a beautiful dining setting especially because we were seated near the windows. I felt like I was inside a series of tall, glass pyramids and could not help but look up and marvel every so often. The bread platter came out before the appetizers, and was a delicious assortment of different doughy and cracker-breads. The caesar salad and clam chowder soup was good.

"Capital Grille is my favorite steakhouse chain, especially in the summer months, when the restaurant is offering the Generous Pour. $28 for a taste of 7 top-rated wines is a great deal and a great way to sample new wines and perhaps find a new favorite. FOOD - My default entree is the Filet Mignon, prepared medium rare, whereas Jon enjoys the Bone-In Ribeye, also prepared medium rare. I've never been disappointed in the entrees and the sides. SERVICE - Usually the service is superb, but on our most recent visit, although we had an 8:30pm reservation, we weren't seated until 9:30pm. I was starving and none too pleased with the service that night, but the bartender was kind enough to get us started on the Generous Pour while we wait near the bar to be seated. Once we were seated, our waiter came by once in a while, but the service was not as attentive as it normally is. This was a rare miss by Capital Grille, but I'm not too concerned because I think it was an off-night for the restaurant.

I highly recommend this particular location, too.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I've dined at Capital Grille for multiple occasions and thought it was a solid 4 star until my last few experiences. *Porterhouse for two: well-cooked, seasoning could be improved. Hit or miss depending on the day, but I feel like the seasoning is consistently lacking. I wish it was a bit more charred for my personal taste. Texture is good as well. *Filet: not my fav, I've only gotten the filet twice and really did not like it. Undercooked, center is lukewarm! Sent it back twice and they did cook it again for me, but the flavor was not the same. ""Sides: portion is ridiculous, they give you like three tablespoons worth of mashed potatoes. Not really good for that matter. Although the food is meh, I do enjoy the ambiance here. Lots of natural light and spacious seating. Service is hit or miss as well. Most time it is good, but some servers have attitude issues! I've seen some eye-rolls hmm..

"I owe this place a Yelp review.  This is based on my experience on 2/10/17.  When my date made a reservation, he mentioned something about celebrating a special occasion.  To our surprise, when we showed up at the restaurant, we were taken to a decorated table with a hand-written card from the restaurant group, thanking us for celebrating a special occasion at the Capital Grille. Our server came over and dropped us a drink menu.  The drink menu is on an iPad, you would be able to see the various categories of wine - white, red, bubbly with their region, description of taste and price.  I find the prices for wine bottles reasonable.  After we ordered a bottle of wine, the server returned with food menus. The restaurant was participating in Restaurant Week on 2/10, so we were able to order a 3-course meal including their regular favorites such as filet mignon or signature sirloin steak.  We both started with clam chowder as appetizer.  The clam chowder was delicious, it has plenty of little clams, the texture is creamy and the taste is not overpowered by the cream.  I highly recommend that.  As we were finishing our first course, the server surprised us with 2 glasses of champagne, he told us it's on the house as we're celebrating a special occasion. Our second course was the filet mignon and signature sirloin steak.  We also ordered green beans and mashed potatoes on the side.  I took a star off because my filet mignon was a bit undercooked.  The center was cold!  The sirloin steak was cooked medium rare as requested and it was flavorful.  I like the side of green beans, it was crispy and just a little bit peppery (but not too much). For desserts, we ordered the flourless chocolate espresso cake and creme brûlée.  The flourless chocolate espresso cake came out in a thin slice, which is the perfect side for flourless cake as the dessert itself would taste heavy.  The cake was delightful.  The creme brûlée is no Le cirque quality, but it's light and it still does its job of tantalizing my taste buds. I ordered a cup of coffee to finish my meal, and thank goodness, the coffee was not lukewarm like in most restaurants :D. Overall, it was a great dining experience, I like the little touches they added in to make a special occasion even more special.  The manager came over to check on our dining experience during the evening, I find it a very personal customer interaction.  I highly recommend celebrating any special occasions at this restaurant.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"We came for lunch during NYC Restaurant Week and were disappointed with everything except the quality of the dry aged steaks. Checking in at the front desk was a crowded, confusing mess. Something you would see at a TGIF or Cheesecake Factory. Why did we have to ask twice for the NYC Restaurant Week menu? If they don't want people to order from that less expensive menu why participate at all in Restaurant Week? Seems like a bait and switch.  First, the Maitre' D promised these menus, which didn't come, and then our waiter kind of sighed when we asked him for the menus and reluctantly   produced 2 folded copies from his pocket! How unprofessional! Regarding the food: the Caesar salads were among the worst and most boring we had ever had. Furthermore, the lettuce was definitely not fresh- already wilted with orange marks from age. The dry aged sirloin steaks were delicious but the salad that came with them was pretty awful. Meanwhile, although I had ordered mine to be medium, I was given an extremely raw piece, with the person delivering trying to convince me it was medium. Luckily, a manager happened by to ask how everything was going. When I asked her about my steak she said that it definitely look raw and that she would replace it. This woman, Jill, saved my meal. The desserts were fine. Hardly the kind of  experience one expects in an expensive, quality steakhouse",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"Capital Grille is a great place if you are hankering for quality steak, and they really help you celebrate special occasions! I took my husband here earlier this year for his birthday dinner and mentioned that in my OpenTable reservation. Well, upon being seated at the table, they left a nice card wishing him a happy birthday and had fun confetti on the table, which was a nice gesture. He also received a candle on his dessert. Similarly, I made a reservation for last night for Restaurant Week dinner to celebrate with 2 of our friends who just got engaged! I also mentioned that in the reservation and our waiter Mark came out with champagne for all of us to celebrate. When my friends ordered their desserts (creme brulee and chocolate espresso cake), their dishes arrived with a candle on top! All of these are small but thoughtful gestures that help the meal feel more special. To move on to their menu: I've had their clam chowder and field greens, both of which were delicious. We also tried the bone-in kona crusted dry aged NY Strip (medium rare), and the bone-in ribeye, which were amazing. My husband loves steak so much and rates this place pretty high up there (with Peter Luger's). For drinks, I enjoyed the Cosmopolitan and my husband likes their whisky selection. For Restaurant Week, there was a more limited menu, but all in all it was still good. One of the managers came over and even checked in on us to see how it was. Come here for the great steaks, fantastic and attentive service, and for a wonderful meal!!",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Coming from Nebraska, I know about great meat. Coming from Nebraska I didn't know a thing about excellent service. Wow! Blown away by the service!!! They brought out a basket of assorted breads, they were all good. We started with shrimp cocktail appetizer, the shrimp were jumbo sized and delicious. I skipped the salads and soups and went to the meat! NY strip, a filet with lobster tail, and tenderloin were all ordered. We traded bites of everything - all cooked perfectly. Best steak I've had ever! We all shared truffle fries - also really good! Couldn't get out without dessert. A gooey chocolate cake with ice cream was a great way to end it & a small celebration plate with cheesecake and coffee chocolate cake was brought out - amazing!! I suppose not mentioning it was (IMO) expensive would be a foul. Things in Manhattan are pricy for sure - so typical of what you pay. We were $240 + a hell of a tip.

"It's been a couple months since my last visit at this location which is across the street from my previous job (and I prefer the layout over the one in FiDi). It's still only a couple blocks away, but I sure as hell wasn't thrilled to go the other day - a day that had nonstop downpours. Well, I'm glad we ended up going for lunch, because it kept me energized through a firm-hosted holiday party later that night. We ordered several lobster & crab cakes ($21 each), salads, and calamari ($17 - huge portion) for the table (there were 8 of us, so that went quickly). I then ordered the sushi-grade sesame seared tuna w/ gingered rice for my entree ($32), and finished off with some cappuccino. The tuna was DELICIOUS. I asked them to make it more on the rare side. My usual go to for lunch has been their Chilean sea bass, which is fingerlickin' good, but the tuna was just as scrumptious. It was seared perfectly, adorned with sesame seeds, complimented by three different sauces. The gingered rice was mouthwatering - sweetly seasoned, with just the perfect hint of ginger for that refreshing aftertaste. Yummmm. Everyone enjoyed their dish, and for a lunch on the pricier side, they do deliver.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I don't normally review steakhouses for obvious reasons (hint hint vegetarian hint hint), but I decided to offer my two cents. If you want to treat a client or colleague to a nice and bit formal/professional lunch, this is the place.  The reason I am particularly impressed is that they always seem to have - what I call - the hidden vegetarian menu of items.  The vegetarian menu usually includes either a pasta dish or a mixed vegetables dish of some sort.  Don't be disappointed though, the meal is actually quite filling. So yes, I'll let my boss and others enjoy the steak or other main entrees and I'll enjoy my meal.  And I'll also get the first class service that comes with the establishment, including receiving warm towels before (and after?) meal, and serving the nice bread plate. Now I probably won't come here on a personal basis due to obvious reasons.  But if I was to tag along on a company lunch, I'd definitely do so and recommend the place while at it.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"They treat you like royalty as soon as you step in the door. Great experience and will definitely go back maybe for lunch or to bring a date. Now the only quandary I didn't care for which was rather annoying, there was a group of people eating on the other side of my table, who were extremely loud obnoxious and using harsh verbiage. It slightly ruined my dining experience, I should have asked to move, but it was late and I was starving. So staff and management should be more aware of dining surroundings. Another point my waiter was ok, I was thinking because it was late, but he didn't smile or check on me enough. I had 2 waiters the other guy was more fun. Maybe that's the set up of the dining experience.

First time at the Capital Grille. Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. I called ahead to let them know what I was celebrating. Asked for a quiet table away from the crowds. When we arrived the table was sprinkled with star confetti and a birthday card from the restaurant. We started with a crab cocktail and mozzarella with 15 year old aged balsamic on heirloom tomatoes. We both had dry aged  porcini rubbed bone in rib eye steaks with a side of asparagus. The appetizer and entree were paired with a wine special that the restaurant was promoting. If you drink more then 2 glasses well worth it. Very high quality (90+) point selections of both whites and reds. After dinner our waiter brought a special birthday dessert out for the birthday girl. Brûlée cheese cake and chocolate flourless expresso cake sprinkled with coco power and raspberry sauce on a plate with Happy Birthday spelled out.  This was paired with a Champagne toast the was complimentary from Capital Grille.

"My first restaurant week experience! Not sure why I waited so long. We came on a Saturday, earlyish evening (at 6pm), at the advice of my friend who said it's less hectic at around this time. The hostesses at the front were incredibly friendly, accommodating., and unpretentious. One of them later in the evening actually came to us with a slight intense look on her face: she wanted to know that we were enjoying our meal. We were! I had the wild salmon and my boyfriend had the steak as our mains. The salmon was amazing, and the portion was just enough for me to finish feeling super satisfied without hating myself. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake which was a delicious way to end the evening. I paired it with a glass of malbec and that was nice too. Our waiter was very professional with a robot's touch, if that makes sense. The vibe of course is very corporate. We saw a man in a booth sporting a combover similar to Donald's.

I wanna say a short prayer of thanks to the chef at this location who prepared my food and blessed my mouth and tummy with the perfectly done salmon that I ordered. It was seasoned so well without being too much if you know what I mean! Salmon can be tricky and kind of unpleasant if not done right.

"Some friends and I came in for restaurant week the other day. We decided to order a bottle of wine and an extra side of lobster mac and cheese off the menu, but otherwise, we stuck with the pri fixe option.

I had the chowder, filet mignon, and chocolate cake. For side dishes, we all split the beans and potatoes. The food was overall very good. My one qualm is that I ordered my steak Medium Rare and it was barely cooked; however, it still tasted excellent. The Lobster Mac is good too, but not worth the $20 price tag. Ambience is typical of a steakhouse. This location is large and has an open feel in the main dining room. We were shoved into a back corner room, so we didn't have much of a view. Service is good.

"On the eve of Snowstorm Jonas, some college fríends and myself, decided to catch up. I suggested Capital Grille, I thought it was the perfect place because I've been here several times, and always was pleased with food and service. However, on this night, the waiter was relatively rude and seemingly disinterested in providing us quality service, but the food was great, as usual. Service: We had a 6:30 reservation and arrived early, we were seated once everyone was present. When the waiter initially came over, we were enagaged in conversation when he asked what drinks we wanted, we were unprepared, this seemed to annoy him and things were down hill from there. Over the course of the night, he brought me the incorrect main course (I wanted steak, I got Salmon), slammed ítems on the table, left us for extended periods of time, another waiter brought me my correct main course (Was very apologetic, while my own waiter said ""You said Salmon, not steak), we were forced to ask a different waiter for another bottle of wine, and for expresso after dessert. If this was my first experience here, it may have been my last, because of the rude treatment of our waiter and feeling embarrassed that I suggested and raved about it to my friends. However, everyone else was extremely pleasant from the hostess, who accomadated us by seating us early. To the friendly people at coat check, to the wonderful guy who brought us bread and continuously checked on us and went above and beyond, to the lovely manager, who went by everyone's table to inquire about their dining experience.

My two both enjoyed their Salmon which I suggested to their delight. For dessert, we all had the crème brulee. It was rich in flavor and definitely hit the spot.

"I've been here 3 times and each time I've always been sat in the back room. Which is this far far away room with about 6 tables. There was more than enough room outside in the main dining room so I really don't see why we had to sit away from human life... The first time I was here was with my family which is a group of 6. We came for restaurant week and noticed they didn't give us the restaurant week menu, we immediately asked the waitress who seemed aggravated just mentioning the word. What's the point of participating in restaurant week if you are going to act that way? Either way some people ordered from the restaurant week menu and some didn't. Which shouldn't even matter in the first place. The fact is there was a certain type of group sitting in this section that I was in and when I mean certain type I mean people who aren't Caucasian. Of course, my sister and I brushed this off maybe this was a coincidence, right? Why would they make us sit in a far backroom and let Caucasians sit in in the main atrium? It's New York for crying out loud we are the most diverse city. The second and third time I was seated in this same exact room... While, the main atrium was basically empty! Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I really hate to think that if I was a Caucasian person that I would be sitting in the atrium so other potential customers walking by would see the type of people that are sitting there. This is sickening. Capital Grille is a microcosm of the prejudice and sad world we live in and I will never be dining here.

Clam chowder and crab cakes were excellent. Lots of flavor in both. However, the beef tartare was honestly awful. No flavor at all. I've had much better elsewhere. Disappointed in that. For an entree, I had the Oscar style filet (crab on top) and this was very good. The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was so flavorful. Absolutely loved it.

It came back, medium now. I can take pink just not with blood still oozing out. This time I just wanted to just take the L. I don't want to piss off the chef (or have anybody spit in my food!). But again the waitress took it back. When it came back, it was perfect inside but outside was too charred. It's okay. I ate it like a champ. When the bill came, I saw that they had comped my steak. Very appreciative they did that. I would have paid for it regardless. But thank you!! I would come back for a 2nd try but not anytime soon. I don't have the paycheck to have steak all the time.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"My family often goes to the Capital Grill in Stamford on special occasions, so I jumped on the opportunity to try this location when I saw they were participating in restaurant week.  They offered a great deal - an appetizer, steak, side, and dessert for $42. We were confused why they didn't provide us with the restaurant week menu when we were seated - they just gave us the traditional menu.  When we asked about restaurant week, our waiter seemed disappointed and we felt pretty uncomfortable.  I'm not sure why they would participate in this but make patrons go out of their way to request the special menu. We had read online that the wedge salad would be one of the appetizer options.  My boyfriend had ordered it on other occasions and loved it.  We were disappointed when it wasn't listed on the menu, but decided to go with caesar salad option.  The salad came out almost too quickly - it was clear in the time and the taste that it had been pre-made.  I wouldn't recommend it. I had the filet (ordered medium) for my entree, and my boyfriend had the sirloin (rare).  We were surprised to find that my steak came out nearly rare, and he discovered at the end of the meal that part of his steak was actually raw.  They were incredibly undercooked.  Looking back, we should have sent them back - I'm sure they would have cooked them more.  But this was disappointing for a steakhouse of this caliber. On the positive side, the sides were good.  I loved the mashed potatoes, and would definitely order them in the future.  We also enjoyed our desserts. I hate to give the Capital Grill a bad review, because I've had so many positive experiences at their restaurants.  However, this experience was really disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for restaurant week.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Never having been to a steakhouse before and seeing the prices, I mentally prepared to still feel hungry after our meal. However, to my surprise, I was more than satisfied. We ordered the filet mignon, ahi seared tuna (cooked medium), and the sea bass. Amazing amazing amazing. A good portion for a steakhouse, great presentation, beautiful setting, and the funniest waiter Alphonso to keep us company while we waited 30+ minutes for our food. The sea bass was for sure the winner in terms of taste which we did not expect. The Ahi tuna, although asked to cook medium, was basically rare so ensure you know how you like it prepared. Also, the calories are written next to each item on the menu- both a good and bad thing. Especially since I thought the prices were calories at one point...",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"4 stars - Everything was great, just wished it was more quiet in the restaurant. I came here for Winter Restaurant Week with my parents and boyfriend for my dad's birthday. We were actually here for restaurant week 3 years ago, and I am happy to say that the food is still just as great, and the portions are very generous considering it's for restaurant week. Service was decent as well. Ambiance is very nice - the structure of the building definitely adds to it. My parents ordered the sirloin steak and salmon, while my boyfriend and I had the filet mignon. I was very impressed by the filet mignon - definitely the best I have ever had (I think I finally understand the meaning of ""melt in your mouth""). My parents enjoyed their entrees as well. For dessert there were creme brulee and espresso chocolate flourless cake. Last time we came here for restaurant week, they ran out of these two desserts so I was glad to finally try them. The creme brulee was so good - just the perfect amount of sweetness. The chocolate cake was dense, and while the chocolate flavor was strong, you can definitely taste the espresso as well. My boyfriend really liked this dessert, but I enjoyed the creme brulee more. I will probably come back here again in the future, but might try the other locations to see what they are like.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"One of my favorite steakhouses in the city. Made a reservation on Opentable and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Once you walk in, you're greeted by really friendly staff, you immediately feel welcomed. The lighting is dark and the whole atmosphere screams romantic date night. They have a cocktail menu displayed on an iPad, which I've never seen before anywhere else. Food was great, steak came out perfectly cooked. But the appetizers lacked seasoning. The string beans and tomatoes virtually had no flavor. The creme brulee was a bit sweet but delicious, i would go back just for it. Drinks wise, the cocktails were STRONG. And i am one that likes my liquor. I hate places who skimp on alcohol, if i wanted juice, i'd order it virgin. Our waiter Tony Vincent was exceptional. He came to check up on us every now and then to make sure our food was served on time and to see if we needed more drinks or just if everything was okay. His service was impeccable, just the extra attention makes a big difference in your dining experience.

"5 star service! Great location and great ambience facing 42nd street. I came to this location a few years ago during my single life; Hubby too but we didn't bump into each other, big world lol. We came here for our anniversary yay! They escorted us to the table assigned by a manager but unfortunately the table was in between two tables without much privacy, it's too close to the left and right tables. Hubby had to say no right away. Usually we really don't mind where our host would sit us but I had to agree with him this time. Try a little romantic! Booth! Or booth with a view. Or booth and relaxation! We needed that. The host moved us right away to the booth that was empty. She was happy to do it and was kind enough to move the colorful confetti on the first table that they set up for our anniversary to the new table, plus the card. Yes! They placed a beautiful handwritten anniversary card. I thought that was excellent! Every little thing goes a long way. I personally enjoy stuff like this. I loved my new table! I had a major allergic reaction at the beginning. We had calamari with hot cherry pepper appetizer. So I had to get some fresh air to breathe. I'm not allergic to calamari so wasn't sure what happened there. While coughing to catch my breath due to allergic reaction (in the restroom), they sent a manager/staff to check on me. I thought that was very nice. After few minutes I was ok and ready to start my anniversary meal but I stopped eating calamari and had it to go so I could continue with my entree. I ordered a 2 lb broiled lobster and Hubby had a porterhouse. I had my entree with asparagus and Hubby got his with soy glazed brussels sprouts and bacon bits. My lobster? It was simply amazing! Cooked to perfection! Hubby's porterhouse was ok. I recommend the lobster! The asparagus was pretty good but the brussels sprouts was to die for. Get this with your entree and you won't be disappointed. I finished my lobster. We took the leftover of the porterhouse, asparagus and brussels sprouts. I tried them all. Our waitress for the night was Diana, a lovely staff. She was on top of her game. She was upbeat, a lot of energy and professional. After the meal she showed us a dessert menu but I just couldn't eat more. However Diana brought us a very lovely Happy Anniversary plate with 2 types of desserts: a slice of cheesecake and chocolate cake. They also brought 2 glasses of champagne so we could end our Anniversary celebration in a romantic traditional way. Had to take the dessert home because I'm not a dessert person although I tried a spoon of cheesecake and thought it was delicious. Cheers to a happy marriage!

Good option for restaurant week prefix menu options ($28). The NY strip streak was a good 8oz size and prepared just right. The clam chowder soup was full of fresh chunks of clam and potatoes.

"I went during restaurant week with two friends.  I had the sirloin, as did another friend.  The third had the filet.  Though I could tell the steaks were cooked well and they tasted fine, the temperature was lukewarm so some of the fat had congealed.  Otherwise, the sides and service were great.  The only issue was with the time spent waiting.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"This is definitely one of the nicest steakhouses in the area, and possibly all of Manhattan. The decoir inside is nice, but not over the top. The exterior of the building is also very aesthetically pleasing. When it comes to service, I've yet to be dissatisfied. The waiters/waitresses are always doing their jobs, and you're unlikely to be left sitting for 30 minutes straight, menu in hand. The food is definitely the main plus, however.

"I entered as a girl, I left as a woman. 1) Dining here has totally refined my idea of what a delicious, medium rare steak is. What I knew before was taken apart and reconstructed at this restaurant. I had the dry aged steak au poivre with cream while my boyfriend had the dry aged steak with cabarnet reduction sauce. Both of our steaks were extremely tender, cooked exactly as we had asked, and was delicious. However, I thought that my steak had a bit too much pepper - but I'm to blame since it was literally in the name. The steaks were nice, thick cuts and it was definitely worth the money since we were extremely full. I think that one steak could've been enough for the both of us as well as the one appetizer we ordered which was very delicious as well (Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella With Vine Ripe Tomatoes) 2) We came here on our anniversary, and WOW i was impressed. They gave us complimentary toasts of champagne, and a beautiful dessert that included their cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake.

At least 4-5 different managers, servers, hosts, sommelier came to ask how things were going. Steak was pretty good, they had a filet minon on the bone special which is unique so we tried it and it was good. Can't beat this place if you're in the area.

"I dine at the Capital Grille, VERY often. Boston, Stamford, Hartford, Providence, Philly, ATL, NYC etc..... And I always have a great experience there! I was just in for dinner with 3 other girlfriends a few weeks ago and didn't have the best experience. The food was very good. One of my friends, ordered salmon but it was too under cooked. The waiter was happy to fix. It took a while but eventually my friend was very happy with her meal. Our server was very friendly and super helpful. The only reason I am giving this review a 2 star is because of how uncomfortable the GM or some type of manager with the ear pieces made us feel. At the end of our meal, My friend got up from our table and joined some other people at their table for a glass of wine, to thank them for the drinks they had previously bought us at the bar that night. But for some reason- the managers had an issue with that. I didn't understand it at all. They were pacing back and forth and clearly speaking about my friend into their headsets. I didn't understand the issue. But we felt totally awkward that the managers were talking shit about us, right in front of us, into their little head sets. So unprofessional. Needless to say that we won't be returning, any time soon. Way too many restaurants around to go somewhere that we felt disrespected.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
For our anniversary we went to our favorite five star restaurant the Capital Grille. From the moment we entered you would have thought we were famous. The service was impeccable and the waiter diligent friendly and attentive. Christian is a server deserving a five star rating himself. Terrell the manager remembered us from last year. The salmon was made to fit each of our culinary needs. The salad was special ordered to perfection as were the side dishes. The complementary champagne and dessert was a total surprise and appreciated. Thank you to every staff member for making our 20th anniversary special.

"02.18.16 @thecapitalgrille Chrysler Center #NYC Lots of suits (which I love), power suits, power deals, power lunch.  Love the energy and vibe here for a business lunch.  Our waiter was excellent!  We ordered the off-the-menu truffle fries.  Grilled Shrimp, Brussel Sprouts, basically everything was delicious. Reservation was for 1:15 and we didn't get seated till 1:30 but lots of eye candy so time flies.

"Outstanding dinner from start to finish, with the only exception being the clumsy server. She was in such a rush with the other tables that she knocked down my kid, and to top it off, was painfully slow with our drink service. Even though she did apologize for the knock down incident, I found it to be unacceptable that she's perpetually barreling down the aisles with huge trays, to the detriment of people's safety. All night she was going back and forth like a beast. She was in such a rush she also dropped part of an app and spilled a water in our table. Total disaster and really not suitable for a restaurant of this caliber. Regarding the drinks, there was plenty of time to kill before the food arrived, so we all decided to have a few cocktails - which were perfect by the way. But after the first one, the waitress totally forgot about us. We're sitting around waiting for refills, looking around to see if we could catch her, to no avail. The drinks remained empty. How hard is it for a waitress to check in and see what's doing? Isn't that a key part of the job? They could have easily sold us 4 or even 6 more drinks in the time that we were waiting. Instead we were left with ice cubs to chew on. It's a shame the waitress wasn't more aggressive because we would have loved more drinks and it's also unrealized revenue for the business. Oh well, their loss. That aside, dinner was great. I was ravenous, so I went with the potato leek soup and steak tartar to open and a 14 oz dry aged NY strip steak au poivre with Courvoisier cream as my entree. I was not disappointed. Everything was sensational, in particular the steak with that amazing Courvoisier sauce. I've never had any sauce like it before. Very nice accompaniment. I hope they keep it on the menu. The check was utterly massive but we all left completely satisfied with our meal. This is a great place to splurge. We will definitely be back.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"The Capital Grille Manhattan does not disappoint. I have always been a staunch supporter of The Capital Grille due to their incredible consistency in creating a perfect medium rare temperature on any cut of meat. I found myself needing a steakhouse in Manhattan and after countless of fantastic trips to the Costa Mesa location, I figured to give the Manhattan restaurant the college try. This location is much smaller than the location I frequent and the floor layout is rather awkward. The menu is a carbon copy of all of the others I have dined at but the fixtures and Tiffany glass didn't seem as elegant for whatever reason (probably the age of the interior). Another huge difference was in the service, the Manhattan waitstaff felt cold and rigid. Not enough to ruin the meal or anything, but you got the sense that they were just going through the motions and I am accustomed to The Capital Grille's waitstaff being ultra-immersed in the dining experience. These (somewhat petty) criticisms aside, what matters is the food preparation and that is where The Capital Grill always shines. This visit was no different. Being very well versed with the menu I went with their excellent Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter offering that was cooked to perfection. The coffee imparts an interesting yet complex savory note to the wonderful cut of meat. For a side the Au Gratin Potatoes always comes through. The potatoes are sliced lengthwise and layered with a blend of cheeses and sour cream. Both items hit the mark and left me completely satisfied. The kitchen definitely was on point for my visit. So, to close, The Capital Grille remains my go-to steakhouse thanks to their impeccable consistency and delicious steaks.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"We came here tonight to celebrate hubby's birthday last Saturday, this is a beautiful restaurant, the high ceiling and glass window are all very pretty, but the atmosphere is very corporate and not romantic at all, I regretted that I didn't read the reviews from other yelpers more carefully, otherwise I would probably choose other steakhouses to go. I really feel this place is not an ideal for a date night. The food we ordered included: fresh oysters, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with vine ripe tomatoes, 24 oz dry aged poterhouse steak, 10oz filet mignon, lobster mac and cheese and wild mashroom. Foods are all decent, but nothing really impresses me. At this point, Strip house is still the top 1 steakhouse in my heart. Service is really really good, our waitress is amazing. I asked her to take a picture for us during our meal and I mentioned we were celebrating birthday. You know what?? She left and brought us a  happy birthday dessert with a lighting candle while we finished our main courses to surprise us, what a nice gesture!  I was really touched.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"Ah!  I absolutely love Capital Grille.  I know, chain steakhouses can't be that great, and although their food is certainly not lacking (it's often one of the better places to dine for Restaurant Week), it makes up for it in service and decor. For Restaurant Week Summer 2015 ($25 lunch, $38 dinner): I made a reservation on OpenTable and was seated within minutes.  The table was a tad bit small and they did run out of RW menus, but  they made up for it with their delicious bread and butter.  For our first course- clam chowder soup.  It wasn't anything special, but it was a simple appetizer, as opposed to the Caesar salad.  Second course, I went with the filet mignon.  It looks like a tiny ball, but have it cooked medium and it's super tasty and filling!  My friend opted for the sirloin with the bone in and it looked much bigger but it a lot of it was the bone.  For our sides, stacked together - mashed potatoes (so creamy, it melts in your mouth practically no chunks if you like unchunky mashed potatoes!) and string beans, which were very flavorful.  I had to end with the creme brulee topped with fresh strawberry, which was just delightful - it was a pretty good portion. The waitress always checked up on us and made sure that everything was great.  The place is a bit dark, but the decor is really nice and really sets the mood for a nice dinner!",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"The restaurant has a difficulty with honoring reservations. We arrived a half hour early and were assured we would be seated on time. When our reservation time arrived it was clear we would not be seated for at least a half hour, an impression that was confirmed by the hostess when she informed us there were 2 parties ahead of us.

"I'm not a red meat eater - if left to my own devices, I can happily subsist on tofu for weeks at a time, and other than sushi and my mom's steamed fish, I don't really go for Nemo either. That said, I won't turn down a good steakhouse, especially when it comes with the best bread basket that has ever crossed my table. How you get your bread so chewy and warm and perfect, Capital Grille? I'm partial to the slices with tomato, onion, and cheese baked on top, though their raisin and walnut-stuffed pumpernickel also deserves praise. Came for the Restaurant Week menu. Unlike my usual go-to order of salmon, I picked the 8 oz filet Mignon instead. It was as good a steak as this sometimes-lazy vegetarian can say, but I liked the Kona sirloin much more. The Kona sauce was delicious - like a onion-flavored gravy. I could eat just the bread and the Kona sauce as a meal. Thanks to the calorie counts on the menu, I have confirmed that dressing adds about 500 calories onto a Caesar salad, and a chocolate hazelnut cake is somehow 1,300 calories. Is it straight up chocolate-covered butter? Do they somehow pipe bacon fat and peanut butter into that thing? Actually, a chocolate-covered butterball of bacon fat and peanut butter sounds amazing.

"My wife and I recently went in to the capital grille for a drink. We sat in the bar area and had a few cocktails. The bartender with longer blonde hair helped us out and was nice at first. When we went to pay we handed them a voucher which we received from one of the other locations because we had a bad experience. They said they couldn't accept the voucher. They sent the manager over to talk to us and the manager said she was sorry but couldn't accept the voucher because it had expired. I can understand that if it was just a random voucher but the fact we were given it because we had a bad experience and they couldn't accept it because they didn't have the ""button"" in the system really bothered me. I have worked in restaurants before. I know if the manager wanted to she could have just taken it off the check. I'm not looking to get free things but the fact that the bartender was extremely rude to me about the situation really put me off. I will not re visit this location. I know if I had gone to the other location it would have been dealt with properly. They did not use the voucher for me and basically said I was out of luck. How unprofessional and disrespectful.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Despite all the good things I hear about this place, it was still just OK. I went here for Restaurant Week so the price was definitely worth it. You get a choice between 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, and 2 desserts and everything can be found online. Upon stepping into the restaurant, we were escorted to our seats. My friend was a little picky about the seat so we changed to another one. Our waiter was extremely kind and would always greet us with a smile. I asked for the wine list and he was very knowledgeable and recommended a really good wine! Except, the wine was the same price as my whole meal :( But that's my fault. My meal didn't blow me away but I'll still give it an average rating for the service. I got the Clam Chowder, Classic Cheeseburger, and the Espresso Cake. Clam Chowder was really yummy and the clams had no sand, something I've learned to appreciate. The Cheeseburger came with really yummy truffle fries but the burger itself was meh. The bun was WAY too burned so I took the top off and had to cut my burger into pieces to eat it. Huge portion though. The cake was pretty good except don't breathe before biting into it or else you will choke on the espresso powder! All in all, the food was ok and the setting was nice. Definitely agree that this place isn't a date place because it gets pretty noisy.

My friend ordered the clam chowder, fillet mignon and cheesecake. I ordered the fresh greens, sirloin and espresso cake. I thought our waiter was pretty friendly! Bread basket came quickly, fresh and warm, but we didn't wanna fill up on bread. My friend liked her clam chowder and my fresh greens were great with a little black pepper. We ordered our steaks medium and shared them, pretty good, texture was almost just right. Desserts, good! Espresso cake was very flavorful and the cheesecake was nice and creamy.

We called later on in the evening to say WTH? and they took our address and sent us a $100 voucher. Which by the way was a nice thing to do - but wont cover dinner there.

We were taken here for dinner on one of our nights in New York and it was a beautiful night. The walk from our meeting was pleasant and as we arrived a bit early we were seated right away in this vast hit ceiling room near the windows looking out on the street. Huge beams and struts internet the space. Our waiter came and gave us water. He was nice but he was so over the top in his manner that it put us both off. I am sure it gets him lots of tips with some people but we found it borderline creepy. Just his style. Our host arrived and the waiter really went over the top in his service. Creepy! He took our drink orders and I was surprised that their beer selection was so small. I would have thought their craft beer selection would be equal to their place. Oh well I chose a local Brooklyn Beer and it was quite tasty. The place started to fill up and started to get very loud and noisy and we were almost shouting at each other by the end of the meal. Not a relaxing place for a good conversation. But everyone around us was having a great time. The food was all good and well prepared but we have had better. It is very costly and you have to buy your vegetables on the side. Where did that custom come from? Guess some folks like it but I just find it pretentious i guess. Just give me some vegetables to choose from and put them on the plate and don't charge me extra for some potatoes or greens. I tried the Creme Brule for desert and it was delicious and well done.

"So what do I know? I actually thought the Capital Grille was the epitome of the upscale power lunch spot for suits found only in the heart of Manhattan. Little did I know there are 44 just like it across the country. Oh well. I guess eating in a chain isn't going to kill me, just hurt my pride in trying to dine at unique eateries in this great city when I'm lucky enough to be here. I stopped by quite spontaneously when I was working the day in the Chrysler Building. I intentionally bypassed the more affordable chain eateries like the omnipresent Prêt A Manger to come here and was quickly sniffed and ignored by the staff at the front podium. I helped myself to the one empty stool at the bar preparing myself for an elbow battle. A turf war was averted when one of my neighboring barflies abruptly left. Feeling guilty at the calorific week I had been experiencing, I ordered the $18 Chopped Salad with Chilled Shrimp which came with an abundant bounty (eight good-size prawns) and a heavy dose of a vinaigrette dressing (see photo). It was satisfying but really not  a standout even for a lunch salad. I was frankly more impressed by the stately decor of the restaurant which included stuffed deer heads mounted on the wall. By the way, the bar staff was far friendlier than the hosting staff just in case you want to make a beeline here. FOOD - 3 stars...reasonably good chopped salad makes for a power lunch for the calorie-sensitive AMBIANCE - 4 stars...the decor fooled me into thinking this was a Manhattan-only operation SERVICE - 3.5 stars...kudos to the bar staff, boils to the rest TOTAL - 3 stars...(sigh) I'm just a link in this chain",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
Went for restaurant week lunch. When shown to our seat we were only given the regular menu. When inquired about the restaurant week menu the waiter said it's only available upon request. It seems Iike a bit sneaky and bait and switch in hopes of hoping people don't know about restaurant week so they can order off the regular menu and not have the cheaper option. Food and service was great though.,3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I made a resevation for Business lunch, l was expecting a great customer service because the restaurant is listed as fine Dining but the service was poor, I asked for olive oil as soon as the server assistant gave us the bread basket but he forgot to bring that and after a long time waiting for it I have to asked him again, they didn't wait  for us to finish our appetizers to  bring the main course,  our waiter never came to check about the food, my sirloin steak was overcook so I have to tell another server about it, the manager bring the new steak right away ( seems that it was pre-cooked) then the server dropped the check and another  server came to pick it up rushing us to put our cards( at that time the restaurant was not really busy that's why I made the reservation for 1:30pm trying to avoid the rush hours) I was really disappointed with the service because I had high expectations from this restaurant but I left very disappointed.",1.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I planned my sister's birthday here last week and had a very average experience. The staff were very friendly and the food was good but we waited about 45 minutes to get our food. It was early in the week and the restaurant was pretty empty so we couldn't understand why it would take so long. Additionally, it just seemed like all waitstaff disappeared/forgot about us, and I had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask about our food. All of a sudden they all came out so we wondered if they had just been sitting in the kitchen and forgotten about. No one acknowledged that it took over half an hour to get food out. At that point, the restaurant was nearly empty and we had all lost our appetites so it just not a great experience - surprising especially for a restaurant of this caliber.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"We used to come here at least once per week...until they started to put the calorie counts for all the items on the menu and we were shocked to see 1000+ for our absolute favorite items such as the porcini-rubbed delmonico as well as the bone-in kona crusted sirloin with shallot-butter.  The most depressing was the calorie count for the pan-fried calamari. So we give up trying to keep the consumption reasonable here, but it is no longer our go to place...ignorance was truly bliss. The wait staff here will freely boast that they have the best cheesecake in the city and it's probably true - I have very little basis for argument.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Came here expecting typical ""upscale chain food"" and really was wowed by my experience. First of all the 2 gentleman taking care of us Sayo and Jango were amazing. They were attentive, friendly and really were able to service our needs fully as we were a group of ""special modifications."" I started with the crab cakes and the tartare which was fresh and really good as I am a frequent eater of both. For salad I had the field greens which was a typical greens salad: tomatoes and a light vinaigrette based dressing. What shockingly surprised me was the Kona rubbed filet. Cooked a perfect med rare+ and the coffee rub complemented the steak perfectly. This was my first time at The Capital Grille and I will be sure to check out the one in my home town as well after such a great experience.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"4 stars for ambiance 3.5 stars for food Conveniently located near Grand Central, this restaurant offers an extensive list of entrees and wines. Came here for restaurant week and tried their filet mignon. It was good, but not amazing. I also asked for it to be cooked medium rare, but the center of the steak looked way too rare for my liking. At least flavoring was on par. The mashed potatoes that came with it were amazing though. They had a few choices of an appetizer and I decided to go with the clam chowder which was decent. Apparently it was supposed to have bacon in it too but I couldn't find any in mine :( I was a little disappointed with how they only had two dessert options only because I did a lot of research for restaurant week and other places offer so many more choices. Their creme brûlée was very satisfying but I would hope to have more options to choose from if I decide to come back next time. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience. The ambiance of the restaurant is great and they seat you right away if you make reservations. Be aware that they only seat you when your full party arrives. It's also very easy to make changes to your reservations last minute so they get a plus for being so accommodating.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Been looking forward to the ""Capital Grille experience,"" but were frankly less impressed. Had the Sliced Filet Mignon and the Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye - the former was exquisite, whereas the latter's balsamic was a bit overpowering.

"We came for the Restaurant Week. This place is packed on a Friday night: better get a reservation. Food: above average, but not necessarily outstanding. I got field greens for starter, the dressing of which was tasty. Age dry sirloin for entree, a bit over cooked. Desserts were brûlée and espresso cake; both were very good. What made this meal a five-star experience was their service. My girlfriend ordered filet mignon at medium rare. When the manager checked on her, she said it was a bit too rare. Then the steak was taken back to the kitchen to be regrilled. Unfortunately, this time the meat was over grilled. Although my girlfriend said it was okay, the manager admitted the mistake herself and took the $38 worth of three course off our bill. I look forward to going back to see they can get medium rare done right.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"My husband and I came here on 06/16/17 to celebrate his birthday.  I made the reservation online via Open Table, and included that we would be celebrating his birthday.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and they were able to seat us right away.  Upon walking to the table, we noticed they had put some birthday confetti and a nice card on the table.  It was definitely a nice little touch to make him feel special.  Our waiter was awesome and made us feel welcome.  He went over the menu in detail and answered any questions as had as well as gave us some good recommendations for drinks.  We ordered cocktails with steaks with mashed potatoes. The food itself was fantastic and definitely filling.  At the end, they surprised us both by bringing out dessert (cheesecake and a coffee cake) on a plate saying ""Happy Birthday.""  The staff at Capital Grill really know how to make their customers feel special and the ambiance of the restaurant is spectacular.   I've been to numerous steak houses in NYC, and while I wouldn't say this was the best steak I ever had, it was definitely delicious and I'd go back again.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"The Capital Grille is one of my favorite restaurants, as I have eaten in them from Boston to DC and I am never disappointed. I took my birthday bride for dinner on 12/16, we had dinner reservations for 5:45, they were more than accommodating and let us eat at 5 instead. My wife had the filet and I had the porterhouse with gorgonzola, and asparagus, the wedge salad had the most incredible chunks of bacon I have ever eaten. As usual, everything was mouth watering, John Silva was our waiter, he seemed to know when we wanted something, and he was always around but never hovering. The manager came by at least twice making sure we were content. Dinner was so filling that we both took home half our meals and a cheesecake for our daughter. Because everything was so good, I way over eat and had the most uncomfortable two hour train ride home, will most certainly be back. Bottom line, awesome food and service, you won't be disappointed.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Great food but service needs work. Like many recent Yelp reviews, I was also here for Restaurant Week with my best friend. Thanks to OpenTable, we were able to make reservations for two on Friday night dinner. A very classy restaurant, I must say. Very simple decor but it is pleasant to the eyes. Appetizer: Clam Chowder My best friend and I both ordered the Clam Chowder. The Clam Chowder had so much clam meat! It was nice and creamy but not too overwhelming. I can definitely taste the clam flavor every bite! It was a very delicious! Entree: Filet Mignon I got the Filet Mignon and it was made perfectly! I cannot take seeing the bloodiness so I ordered Medium-Well (sorry, steak-connoisseurs!) . However, my steak came out Medium not how I wanted but it was a good mistake. My steak was juicy and turned out to be perfect for my taste, though I still would not mind Medium-Well! The middle was still pink. I underestimated the 8 oz. steak, it was indeed very filling and it was really good! I love the charred on the outside and tenderness on the inside! I would opt out of the Jumbo Shrimp option for extra $10.00 charge. My best friend got it and I had a taste. It was not fresh and it had a funky seafood smell. You do not have to be a food critic to tell, that's how obvious it was. Not worth it. Side: Sam's Mashed Potatoes The mashed potatoes were very dry and lack flavor. They have too much potato skins in there in my opinion. It was not creamy but rather very difficult to eat because it was too sticky and dry. It's not bad... just okay. Dessert: Cheesecake with Berries & Creme Brulee The Cheesecake was alright. I love the creaminess of the top part and it was pretty creative that they put that layer of burnt sugar on top. Not only it made the plain cheesecake look more pretty but it adds an unique taste to it. Creme Brulee: We went beyond the Restaurant Week menu and ordered the Creme Brulee. I felt the dessert is very mediocre. I had better creme brulee elsewhere. I felt like the sugar coat layer was too weak - in fact, I did not even taste it and really, it's the supposed to be the best part! Service... Needs improvement. Honestly, our waiter and server was pretty friendly. My biggest issue with the service was the fact that they got our orders wrong...twice! I realized another Yelper also had a similar experience, therefore, I can agree with her comments. First of all, my best friend ordered her steak Medium-Rare and it came out too overcooked for her taste buds.She did not enjoy it. I mentioned above that I ordered Medium-well and it came out much rarer - Medium. Luckily, for me it was not bad of a mistake. Secondly, we both ordered Cheesecake but he came with the Chocolate Flourless Cake. This is not what we ordered. It's obvious, that the waiter did not write down our orders. I think this is the problem, we know that they are a high volume restaurant especially during Restaurant Week Dinner service. I would not mind him taking a few seconds just to write down what we ordered instead of trying to take down each table's order by memory. Overall, the steak was great and I enjoyed it. However, I did not get the best service that was promised.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

It was expensive (I think our group bill was around $800 - $900) but we felt it was completely worth it.

"This was a DISASTER of a dinner experience. My family was all in town, so we wanted to do a dinner out. Granted, it was a large party of 15 for dinner, but Capital Grille had multiple problems with executing our meal. The servers seemed very confused on what everyone had ordered. Even though we all ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu. They didn't know who ordered what for every stage of the meal, from starters to desserts. And the entrees were the most disappointing. Three in our party opted for the bone-in sirloin steak, and all three had to send their steaks back. Two of the three ordered medium rare, and the steaks came out medium well. When the steaks came back out, despite them being charred on top, the insides were rare, rendering them rubbery and inedible. They were a weird and terrible combination of being undercooked AND dry. Even if they had been sent back a second time to be cooked longer, the steaks were already dry - it would have only made the steaks COMPLETELY dry and tasteless. These two were pretty much left on the plates, untouched. The third that ordered the bone-in sirloin was pregnant and had ordered her steak well-done. I wasn't sitting near her, but her steak had to be sent back twice. This was a very disappointing meal. The least you can ask for at an establishment is that the food be edible :(",1.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"This place is a chain, and the food reflects that. Also, this is a place for business lunches/dinners so you're paying for the service and ambiance. If we're strictly talking food, a lot of the food is heavily salted, and sometimes overcooked and overseasoned. For example, my husband got a medium rare burger, which was cooked beyond medium. If you're going to pay $19 for a burger, it should be medium rare. We told the server this though and the food was comp'd (still we would prefer the food we wanted). I got a cobb salad, which was heavily dressed, but the tenderloin was cooked to medium rare as requested. I've gotten salmon and other items here before, and this place is overrated for the food. If you want service and ambiance and taste is not a big deal to you, this is a good place to go.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"What a disappointment. Came here with my family for my sister's birthday on 8/15 as they were taking part in NYC Restaurant week. The first issue was that the restaurant week menu we were presented did not match what was being advertised online (different cuts of steak and no wedge salad). As soon as we ordered off the restaurant week menu the waiter became extremely rude and wanted nothing to do with our table. Two people in our party ordered Filet & two others ordered salmon. We asked for the salmon to be prepared plain (no sauce or brown butter) and again the server was agitated and the manager had to come over and confirm we wanted it that way which seemed odd. At the time the food tasted fine, however several hours later myself and my sister both became sick. The next morning my father was sick as well. The culprit had to be either the Caesar Salad or mashed potatoes as those were the only two dishes the three of us all ate. I tried to speak to a manager yesterday but could not get a hold of one and I also emailed the restaurant directly before coming here to review and that email also went unanswered. What started off as a meal I was really looking forward to became a terrible experience.

"The name of this place really does it a disservice since this is a good moderate to high end steakhouse and somewhere that everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed.  I made some notes during our visit specifically to assist with my Yelp review and they go along the lines of ""Awesome"", ""Superb"", ""How a steak should be"" and ""Worth the expense"" - I think those there should tell you enough and that this is somewhere I would highly recommend. However, for those who would like more, let's dig a little deeper into the specifics. To start off, the interior, mood lighting, and general ambiance of this place is very relaxing and speaks to what you expect a restaurant of this caliber to be.  The service was really good too and up to par with what I would expect of a place like this.  Our server (Matthew) was very friendly, courteous, fast, and efficient.  He was always available when we needed him but also not too over the top, and he allowed our group the space to enjoy the experience.  I say that last part because sometimes, especially when you're with a party, overbearing service really can get annoying and I think it's the mark of a good restaurant when the servers understand that. Of course all this would be moot if the food was not also up to par.  Well let me say it truly was on all fronts.  Not one of us left disappointed.  Several of us had Filet Mignon which was superb and cooked perfectly medium rare as asked for.  However, the true highlight was the Filet Oscar, a Mignon topped with some superb tasting crab.  Everyone that tried it said this made the meal and was something they would absolutely get on a return visit.  The side's too were all really good including the mashed potatoes and the roasted wild mushrooms. I do suspect such a return visit would indeed by on the cards next time I find myself in New York.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Shame on you. Went in for a Restaurant Week Lunch. While I know that restaurant week menus are generally not indicative of the restaurants normal offerings, at least put some effort into it.  I've been to enough restaurant week meals to know the deal. You get the cheapest options but at least it's an opportunity to enjoy an restaurant you might not normally enjoy. I ordered the aged sirloin.  This could not have been more than 4-5 ounces.  Now I'm not saying that for restaurant week lunch menu they should be providing 12-16 oz pieces of sirloin, but C'MON!!  This was embarrassingly small. It really was teeny.  F*cking teeny!  THIS ... is the reason why restaurant week has jumped the shark as of several years ago.

"I gave it one star because the service was horrible. I have been here about 2 or 3 years ago for RW and I liked it so I thought why not go again? First when we got there, the receptionist was super snobby. I was like at the counter but she did not even acknowledge me until I opened my mouth. Then she did not provide any instructions and we were left hanging around the reception area like idiots. Then we were brought to our seats by a very nice lady. After a while the waitress came and started introducing the menu. We asked for the RW menu since they don't provide it unless you ask. Everything was fine until the main course came. They literally had no idea who ordered what. We had to play merry-go-round like twice to get the correct dish. Since there were two filet mignons, one medium and one medium rare, we didn't know which is which until it was cut. So basically I was very annoyed at how much they messed it up. Then at one point, my friend's water was filled but mine, basically empty, was not. I had to wave someone down. First of all, a good restaurant knows never to leave a customer's cup empty. Second of all, why didn't you fill mine when you filled my friend's????? Also our waitress would start talking to us during our conversations. That's so rude! I guess I also walked in with higher expectations since it is a nicer restaurant but I feel like even the basics wasn't met. HORRIBLE! Food wise: The clam chowder was really good for appetizer. The sirloin and filet mignon are fine. The creme brulee was better than the espresso chocolate cake but both were good.

I expected, for the caliber of this restaurant, for the steak to be extraordinary but maybe I expected a little too much. Other than the sirloin, the fries that came with my friend's burger order was delicious, crispy and hot with a good note of garlic. The clam chowder was DELICIOUSLY creamy, and the cheesecake was so soft and not as heavy as the typical New York style cheesecake. Pleasantly surprised. The service was also superb for us.

"TL;DR Best Restaurant Week food I've had.  Bone in Sirloin. If this restaurant provides sub par food for restaurant week goers than I imagine the steak from the actual menu tastes like Peter Luger's stepson (I mean it'll be phenomenal). I've never had great meals with restaurant week.  It might be my fault for choosing the wrong things, or just bad luck, or what i suspect to be restauranteurs serving shittier food to patrons specifically there for restaurant week. But this place had some bomba$$ sirloin.  I ordered the following: clam chowder:  cause the other two choices for restaurant week were weaka$$ salads I ordered a soup that most steak houses rarely mess up.  They did not mess up...standard clam chowder flourless choclate espresso cake: for dessert, it was this or creme brulee...I had a creme brulee donut before I ate dinner so I went with the cake.  The cake was good, but I made a rookie mistake and ate it with some cabernet...my mouth started having that extreme puckering feeling, everything felt more alcoholic, and my asian glow turned into an asian fire cracker which i guess was very fitting for chinese new year. dry aged bone in sirloin 14oz:  ordered medium rare, color inside was right, the tenderness was completely left intact.  great fat and meat balance.  was not charred to a crisp but still had that cancerous leftover on the meat.  No steak is good if it does not increase your chances of cancer.  I put that chunk of end piece i sliced in my mouth and it was like the cow decided to sh!t a piece of beef in my mouth. Also a side note.  they use a tablet for their wine selection which was sorta fun playing around with .",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"Was there last night. Not a single negative thing to say about this place. All the staff were super professional, accommodating and nice. Leo was my waiter and was terrific. They do everything right from start to finish. My Rib-eye was cooked to perfection, My wife's Filet was also cooked to perfection, Mixed drinks were spot on. Beautiful dining room, comfy chairs, padded table, it doesn't stop....perfect after perfect after perfect. . The works.  If you haven't tried this steak house, you should. They did not miss a single thing.  I will definitely be going there again.  A true gem, 1 short block from Grand Central Station.  Nice job, I've been at steakhouses all over the city, and I am not easily impressed, read my other reviews. This one can compete with the best of them.   Even some of the super famous steakhouse names that you know have been disappointing me lately. Not this one. Great job. Three apps, three mixed drinks, bottle of peligrino, filet, rib eye, one side, 135 per person including tax and tip. Ladies and gentlemen, that's my time.............",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
The food here is amazing. The service is first class. It is a very well run restaurant. I usually take clients here when I am trying to close a deal our correct outstanding balances.

The decor of the place is very different and unique. A great atmosphere to enjoy dinner with friends. The good is great. I came here during the restaurant week therefore the selection is limited. But good. I had the salmon vad it was delicious. I don't cook with a lot of salt so therefore the food was a bit salty to me. The bread basket and butter were good. They added salt on the butter. It is a good blend. The wait staff were polite and nice. The service was great. Though there were lots of people but they didn't rush you. Our waiter was very sweet and very polite. Will definitely come back to the Capital Grille but want to try the other locations.,5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"This place is great! The sirloin and lobster tail combo I had was deliciously tender and seasoned well. The best part was the lobster mac and cheese, which I really wish was my meal, as it was out of this freakin world. We'll probably just go back for platters of that..

"I really enjoyed my experience at The Capital Grille! I went there for a dinner the day after my birthday, but one of my friends must have tipped off the restaurant, because they had confetti spread around our table and put together a really awesome dessert spread! I loved the decor of the main dark wood-paneled room, which felt very much like an old-school steakhouse. We sat in the more modern room, which bumps right up against 42nd Street, so the street view isn't that pretty. I highly recommend the Filet Mignon and the Lobster Mac & Cheese...there were absolutely  no crumbs on my plate at the end of the night. This is a great place for a business dinner, especially if you work in midtown. But maybe try one of the other steakhouses in the area if you want to really impress out-of-town family or a date.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

Took my daughter here for her birthday and was not disappointed. Just small touches such as a complimentary champagne toast and a ginger ale float for her was a nice touch. Lobster Bisque was delicious with big pieces of succulent lobster. Sliced filet was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection (Medium well). The lobster mac and cheese was light and creamy with juicy pieces of lobster and the brussel sprouts with bacon was simply awesome.  Hands down what you expect at a fine steak house. Left full and satisfied and my daughter had an awesome time.,5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"Located in the Chrysler builder, the dining area featured high ceiling and a great bar area to catch some TV action. Even in NYC, it is still a pretty good choice when it comes to steakhouses. However, the biggest problem is the consistency of the quality. Being a chain restaurant, that's always one of the hardest things to manage. Someday the bone in ribeye, lobster bisque and the service are on par with any michilin star restaurants in the city, but another day, it could really suck. During my latest visit, during restaurant week, I saw the worse of this place...the host and the wait staff treated you without much professionalism, the food wasn't bad but it's not what you would normally expect from capital grille. All in all, I would still dine at this place, but it wouldn't be on my top 5 steakhouse list.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

I had the bone-in Kona with truffle fries, macaroni and cheese, and creamed corn. Everything was beyond delicious!!

"My boyfriend took me here two weeks ago for our anniversary. He told them beforehand that it was a special day and they went absolutely above and beyond and made it the most special day. Our table was decorated with a happy anniversary card and had adorable heart confetti. Our waiter was absolutely awesome, JD I believe was on his name tag. We were offered complimentary celebratory Moet, and some pineapple vodka. I'm not a vodka girl but that drink was amazing! All the food we ordered was delicious but I felt that my steak was kind of tough to chew. It tasted amazing but I just couldn't chew through the meat, but that's okay. I've had worse. We were also given a complimentary celebratory dessert with ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate on the plate. I was already emotional over the wonderful experience and that just tipped me over the edge and sent some happy tears rolling. My boyfriend and I felt so special. I'm so, so happy that we chose this place to celebrate our special day. Will definitely be back and will definitely personally request JD to be our waiter!

"Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere. If I didn't already know it was a chain, I never would have suspected it. The restaurant itself was beautiful - well-dressed (and well-spaced, particularly for Manhattan) tables in a tastefully decorated room under a glass-prism ceiling. The service was perfect - just the right amount of interaction (I hate when servers and staff are in my face) and with exceptional recommendations. I wanted to start off with a glass of white wine but was in the mood to try something new; the waitress asked for my preference and suggested a Spanish white that was just right. The food was absolutely perfect. I tried the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms, cooked medium. The center was pink and warm but the outside was lightly charred and perfectly seasoned. Served with its juices and a healthy array of mushrooms and onions, the steak was everything I could have asked for. I shared the Parmesan Truffle fries with my boyfriend who recommended them and they were fantastic as well. I don't usually (ever) order fries at a fine dining establishment but these completely changed my view on fries. For dessert, we tried the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake which was rich and delicious and perfectly paired with a raspberry sauce. The coffee was outstanding as well. I usually throw a bit of sugar and cream in mine but I couldn't bare to ruin this perfect cup. I would definitely recommend The Capital Grille. It's a bit pricey, understandably - but it's worth the splurge to celebrate a special occasion. I will definitely be back.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

I came here for restaurant week last night. I really enjoyed the food..steak was excellent and you get really the best for restaurant week. My server was also very pleasant as well. However towards the end of the meal the staff kept coming to the area where I was sitting (in the back) looking for tables to clear up. We kept getting stared at to the point where we were being watching when I would finish my cappuccino.

"If you stick to standard steakhouse fare, TCG has it down. The ever-flavorful, perfectly seasoned kona-crusted sirloin is consistently one of the best steaks I am aware of, and I used to enjoy the Lobster Mac & Cheese as well.* The steakhouse sides (creamed spinach, etc.) are solid, and they know how to make a Caesar salad and a martini as well as any joint in town. However, if you're going to charge $16 for it, you need to learn how to make a decent Manhattan. That beautiful bar should be good for something besides middle-aged men clumsily accosting well-dressed divorcees. Now, I've always been fond of The Capital Grille. After visits to a few locations, I'd consider it to be one of the better chains out there. My last visit here, however, I was a bit disappointed in the execution of certain items, especially when you take the price point into account. The aforementioned Manhattan was my first clue. And then the ""fresh"" mozzarella, basil and tomato salad was largely tasteless and limp. The Citrus-glazed salmon was overcooked and under-seasoned. Of course, nothing was inedible, but when the average entree costs more than $40, it had better be excellent. Basically, if you don't try to branch out, they make the meal worth the price tag. ___________ *One gift that Overlord Bloomberg has provided us with is that chain restaurants are required to list the calorie counts on their menus. This is why I now know that the Lobster Mac & Cheese is actually over 1,500 calories on its own. Thanks Mike, but I think I would've been happier not knowing that. Because that shit is delicious. On the bright side, it made me feel justified in eating two steaks, as they came in around 1,000 calories.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I went here for restaurant week and I was blown away.  This was so far the best restaurant in  my restaurant week ventures. The bread bowl here was also amazing!  A variety of bread for you to try and not just regular boring bread rolls.  I had the onion roll and it was sooo good it was to die for.  There was a brownish-looking bread that was also fantastic (a cross between a cake and a bread) but I have no idea what the bread was. What I ordered (and generally what my friends also ordered too): Clam Chowder = plain and simple Bone-in dry aged sirloin steak 14oz with shallot butter = the shallot butter was a bit too salty for me, however, the steak was an enormous portion, well worth the $38 restaurant week deal.  My medium rare option also came out just as ordered, which is not usual as many restaurants can't seem to stop cooking it until it is done. Creme Brulee = a classic and a great end to a fantastic dinner In addition to all this food, we also got a platter of creme spinach and mash potato to share!  Talk about too much food!  Super worth it to come here for restaurant week.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

You could barely give the hostess your name. Good news was that once we were checked in, we were seated quickly (8:15pm Friday night). Once the waiter realized we were ordering off of the restaurant week menu, he seemed to not really want to be bothered with us. There were seven women at the table, and I can only speak for myself, but I thought the food was good, but not great.

"I like steak.  PETA supporters shudder visibly as I pass their picket lines on the street.  We get to eat steak 'cause we're high on the food chain.  And thank God.  'Cause I like steak. These guys are good at steak.  They are very proficient at everything that goes along with the normal beefsteak trencherman's delight in NYC.  You pay the going rate of $35 million dollars for it too, but that's average for high-end steakhouse in NYC. These guys are refined.  Nicer than average bar area, not too noisy, professional maitre d' and waitstaff.  Good decor and comfy seating.  Makes Luger's look like a frathouse and Keens Steakhouse like somebody set up tables on a porch.  Don't get me wrong: those places have great steak.  But they look like the country cousins of this place.  If you look good in a suit, you'll like it here. Did I mention very professional waitstaff?  Because they are. Food is good.  Had the normal big-ass salad with gorgonzola all the Hell over it with bacon because why not?  Followed by a big-ass steak and sides of creamed spinach and fried potatoes.  All good.  Not stellar, but I was happy.  It's not the Jean George's of steakhouses, but it comes pretty close. All in all, if you want a civilized steak, here or the Benjamin Steakhouse are two good choices.  The food's a little better at the Benjamin, the decor and ambience here.

"3.5 stars. I'm low balling frankly because Capital Grille doesn't need Yelp help from little ole me. It's a nice run of the mill steakhouse, though I prefer Wolfgangs, Maloney and Porcelli or even Smith and Wollinsky. I came here for a work lunch at 12:30, Friday. It was the same idea much of Corporate America had so make a res. it also seems as though they have tons of tables so fret not. Attire  is business cas, and decor is you know..old timer steakhouse. We were sitting by the window and as an FYI it was really cold. My partner and I shared the crack cakes- nice crunchy on top and good fill with the meat. I appreciated the side of tartar sauce and corn. The were a good size but not jumbo. The server served it onto our plate. Overall he was very polite, nice and refilled our waters. But the waitstaff was inconsistent- we had a few different waiters bring out different plates, one asked if we wanted bread (we declined, but isn't that standard?). We ordered a cup of soup next- my partner the lobster bisque (a special), me the clam chowder (very bland unfortunately- too much cream, not enough seafood). Our waiter didn't bring out fresh pepper right away, but he came back around later. For our mains, I had the miso cod special. The cod was good with crunchy Panko bread crumbs and crispy skin. It was flavorful and fresh and a goof portion. However, the miso sauce was overly salty and it drenched the underlying veggies big time (carrots, cabbage). My partner had the steak special. Ironically, I don't eat steak (hey she picked the place) so I sort of zoned out on what this was. Looked small but im sure it was filling- it's beef, a big chunk of meat! Lastly for desert. I wanted something on the light side as this was a lot of food, so I got the strawberries capital grille. It was strawberries soaked in grand mariner (that was definite a potent flavor) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (which was more watery than creamy). I was happy with the strawberries, though. My partner ordered the creme brûlée. I didn't try it but it looked creamy and smooth.  She also had two diet coked and a mint tea. The total bill came to nearly $180 after tip. It'd definitely not cheap, and not good or intimate enough for me to return on My own accord. I'm glad I got it off my work lunch list, though.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Rude service! I've been to Capital Grille at the Theatre District and I was very satisfied with the food and the service so I decided to give this location a try. Food was honestly not bad but the service at this location was horrible. It was so disgusting I could barely finish my meal. I came with my brother and we both ordered from the restaurant week menu. We both ordered clam chowder for appetizer, dry aged sirloin steak for entree (he ordered his medium and I ordered mine medium rare) and cheesecake for dessert. First of all, my clam chowder was cold. When I told my waiter Cassidy, she rudely rolled her eyes and took the soup away without saying a word or apologizing. Second of all, the server switched our entrees. I asked the server to confirm which order was medium and which one was medium rare, he states all orders are based on a number seating system. When I cut into my steak, it was not as I expected. It was too well done for me and when my brother cut into his steak, it was too pink for him. Obviously the number seating system didn't work in our favor because they switched our orders. Rude! Our waiter Cassidy never came to check on us and never refilled our glasses from the bottle of wine we ordered. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to pour my own wine when I order bottles. It's not a big deal but it was disturbing. Wait... It is!! I ordered a bottle, pour my damn wine, damn it! Oh and wait I lied, Cassidy came to check on us one time awhile after my brother and I have finally discovered they switched our entrees. I asked her why my steak was burnt and she explained the steak was cooked on a grill so it's a little charred. I accepted her explanation. She immediately walks to another server that was standing less than 2 feet away from us, starts looking our way and was mumbling about how I complained my steak was burnt. Hello? I'm sitting a couple inches away from you!! I can hear your conversation woman! Third of all, my brother and I both ordered the cheesecake but they gave him the Chocolate mousse instead. Our waiter Cassidy, was not to be found so we told another server, Feddric. He roles his eyes and snatched the plate away. He returns sliding/throwing the plate on the table in front of my brother that the plate almost fell because it was sitting halfway on the edge. I immediately asked for his name and my waiter's name. He got nervous and asked if everything was okay and gives me a smile. Umm.. Fake! What the hell just happened? Why was the plate thrown at my brother? My dessert came with fruits and raspberry sauce and his had no sauce, which also wasn't a big deal but it comes to show how rude and careless the servers at this restaurant are. Food was honestly 3.5-4 stars but service was horrendous. I won't be returning to this location. I suggest going to the one in the theatre district. Btw did I fail to mention, after we were done with dessert there was a spider crawling down from the ceiling. It crawled down to my plate and I killed it with the towel. Horrible experience! Please clean your restaurant! Oh and please hire friendly staffs!",1.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Not that awesome experience. Came here for business lunch for New York restaurant week with a party of four additional guests. First of all, the waiter never even gave us the NY restaurant week lunch menu. The variety they had for restaurant week was also ridiculously disappointing and having been to a Capital Grille for Boston restaurant week dinner, would say that it was several echelons below what I've known of this restaurant. Then the food itself also wasn't that great. I ordered the burger and I could have gotten a better one at Five Guys... which I would have much rather ate in my office cubicle (save the company, which was great). The service was also just really weird in the sense that the place was trying to give off a high class, $$$$$ vibe but that just didn't really mesh well with the lunch atmosphere and the fact that we were all wearing casual clothes and really didn't care. Food portions were also quite tiny in my opinion and the salads that my friends ordered looked like they were made out of expired lettuce. The only redeeming thing about this place I'd say is the ambiance, which is great. The setting is pretty awesome as whoever invested in this place obviously put a ton of money making sure that it looked nice. Otherwise, the weird paintings were kind of offsetting and the taxidermy combined with the service and the not so great food were all a letdown.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
Service was outstanding and the selection on the menu had enough diversity to please everyone at the table.

This is where you get a sampling of 7 different wines (only about half glasses) during your meal. Of yhe 7, my favorite wasthe Pinot Noir; she the Caberner Sauvignon.  I don't think there were any bad choices, though the Riesling was too sweet for me. We shared and started with the reds because we had plans to eat some delicious steaks, which we did. The dry aged sirloin was incredible and so was the filet mignon.  Both were cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were a perfect consistency. For dessert, they had a cheesecake which I thought was the only average part of the meal and a flourless chocolate espresso cake. It was like a soft fudge, so rich in chocolaty goodness. Definitely check this place out. Service was excellent as well.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"About par for what I expect at a better restaurant.  We're in city for a conference and wanted a nice dinner before 'Wicked'.  We chose Capital because it was close to our hotel and fellow reviewers gave good marks. Our waiter timed our entrees to meet the showtime.  We also ordered soup, three 'share' items, a salad, and wine so the bill for three us was higher than planned but gives us a chance to provide a balanced review . Potato leek soup was good but I wouldn't order it again because the clam chowder was done very well. The asparagus was okay, slightly undercooked in my opinion but well seasoned.  Our group liked both the lobster Mac and brussel sprouts/bacon better- both delicious. The sirloin steaks and porterhouse were perfectly cooked and very tender. Everyone from desk to water to servers were professional, friendly, courteous, neat as one would expect.  My water started to get low once but they came by in time. My daughter had a raspberry champagne (Bohemian) drink - good.  The electronic note book  drink selection menu was nice. The only hiccup was our wine order which was delayed by an honest mistake.  I don't pretend to know wine but was pleased that the Cabernet did not have a bitter finish and satisfied the others who generally drink sweeter wines. Our waiter brought over chocolate-covered strawberries for everyone at the end of the meal!

"I mainly write positive reviews. Went here for a team dinner. I ordered a nice scotch and waited over a half hour for it. I had to ask three times for the drink. Everyone toasted and I didn't even have a water. Waiters didn't give us water, nor did they ask if we wanted. Back to my scotch...I asked a manager and in no great haste, finally the waiter brought the drink. A minute later they accidentally brought a second scotch. Great. Leave the second one...I'll get to it. I was nearly finished with the first and had a solid last sip left. Turned to speak with my colleague and turned back around to a waiter removing my drink. Didn't ask if I was finished. Just took the drink. Appetizers were mediocre. Fried calamari was not good. Jumbo lump crab cocktail was decent but they didn't bring cocktail sauce - what?!?!?! Finally brought cocktail sauce after someone asked and it was too late. I'm sorry but a $19 lump crab appetizer should come with the proper fixin's, as they say. As I'm writing, I'm realizing how bad the service was. My steak and the lobster mac and cheese were the redeeming parts of dinner. If the steak and lobster mac were not primo, I would have rated 1 star. Actually, maybe I should give one star because they took my plate before I had a chance to finish my steak. I had my final bite of steak queued up and ready to go. Got distracted in conversation for one minute....took my plate!! The guy tried to ask me if I wanted the plate back....wtf?!?!?!

My appetizer was a Caesar salad, which was fairly average. Nothing about it blew my mind. I actually wasn't too crazy about the dressing. Little too tart for me. My boyfriend got the clam chowder and loved it. My entree was the Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. The steak was really tender and cooked exactly how I requested. Whatever sauce they put on it was great. The mashed potatoes were probably some of the best I ever had, and they gave us a lot of them. We got both desserts (cheesecake and flourless chocolate espresso cake) and shared them. I was so stuffed by then, but sampled each dessert and was really pleased with both of them. We also did the Generous Pour option, where they add $25 per person onto the bill and everyone gets to sample 7 wines throughout dinner. WHAT AN AWESOME IDEA! Our glasses were never empty (if you watch How I Met Your Mother, it was exactly like the ""Thank you, Linus"" episode). The wines were amazing and complimented the meal so well.

We weren't overly hungry so we ordered one of their specials, which was a bone-in 16oz filet, medium rare. It was just ok... Kinda tasteless and nothing spectacular.

"A perfect choice for a midtown indulgence in the heart of the Grand Central area. Instead of money spend on the likes of Pershing Square and Bobby Van's Steakhouse (even if it was on a corporate card), Capital Grille is an exciting choice that boasts a stellar seafood/steakhouse combo menu for lunch or dinner. Whether you are in the mood for an 8 oz. (or 10 oz) sirloin (medium-rare) with sides of mash potatoes and creamed spinach, or a Signature Cheeseburger with truffle fries, the meat is perfectly tender and flavorful. For non-beef eaters, the seafood options also aim to please. The seared salmon or an order of the Lobster and Crab Cakes appetizer with a cup of French Onion Soup is a fulfilling, light lunch. To cap it all off, the soft Chocolate Hazelnut Cake, lathered with dark chocolate mousse and coated with hazelnut/chocolate ganache, is a monstrous, 1300+ calorie slice of heaven.

"1 star for service, food 3 stars for location, so I averaged it to 2 stars. Starting off, the location is great and convenient to get to. This is where the good points of this restaurant end. I had come here with my girlfriend for a lunch during restaurant week. I ordered a caesar salad, a sirloin, and a flourless espresso cake, while my girlfriend had a clam chowder, a burger, and then a creme brulee. The salad looked woefully limp, piled on to a flat ""buffet""-esque plate just as I would have done myself at an all you can eat. Nitpicking a little, the croutons were unevenly sliced, with the larger pieces undercooked and the smaller pieces overcooked as you can imagine. Similarly, the chowder tasted as though it came straight out of a can. Amazingly, I could have expected a better first round at an Applebee's. The second course fared a bit better, with the steak being cooked as ordered. However, the accompaniment, arugula salad, tasted so incredibly bland I could have cried into it and it would have tasted better. The burger fared no better. The patty, while cooked well, had a taste reminiscent of the existence of Bigfoot; that is to say its existence was dubious as best. The lettuce looked and tasted old, the cheese overpowering, and the fries obviously not freshly fried nor even recently reheated. For the dessert, while I can understand prepping the plates early in the morning, the sauce garnish was placed on the cake so long ago that it was stuck to the plate. The raspberry garnish on the cake was also, you guessed it, old. The cake itself thankfully tasted fine, not overly sweet with the taste of coffee not overpowering. The creme brulee sure looked cute! That's the end of my praise for that one. This was also obviously prepared (hopefully) way early in the day, with the crust not even warm and barely existent. The taste of the custard was also slightly off for reasons I can't quite word, but off-putting enough for my girlfriend to not even finish one of her favorite desserts. The service was also subpar for the price or ambience, with my water cup filled at the moment we were seated, empty by the end of the first course, and only refilled when our dessert orders were being taken. At one point, the servers hadn't even asked who ordered which dish and blindly placed our entrees (incorrectly) in front of whoever was closer to him. Ultimately, I could have spent $30 at a McDonalds and still end up much happier with the quality of service and food. Avoid.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

The restaurant is loud!  You are seated on top of each other and basically could participate in the table next to yours conversation.  I dined with my husband and son and unfortunately, my lamb chops were overdone.  They took them back and when they arrived again, they were undercooked.  I asked for medium rare and neither orders were cooked properly.  They issued a credit but I did not have a meal.  So, I would be very wary of this restaurant.  If you like a long wait, a loud atmosphere - this is the place for you.",2.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

That is ok as the service was completely stellar.  The bartenders worked quickly making drinks and making merry with the guests.  You could tell they had a lot of regulars as they seemed to know a lot of people on a first name basis.  They did a good job making strong drinks.  We also got some bar food as well:  parmesan truffle fries, mozzarella/crisp prosciutto/basil mini sandwiches, and mini tenderloin sandwiches (sliders to you and me).  The food was a bit decadent, but all of it was very delicious. I have been to a few Capital Grilles and they are all very good.  This one is, too.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"I also came here for RW cause there's no way I would be able to afford it other wise! Once I arrived I was captivated by the atmosphere, actually I couldn't see anything at all cause it was pretty dark in there, but not dark enough to see the frowns on  the hostesses faces. It was a gloomy start to the evening but it got better once we were seated. Our waitress was lovely! I wish I remembered  her name. She was very patient with us as well as helpful. The menu for RW allows you to choice an appetizer, entree, an accompaniment, and of course dessert. I got clam chowder, salmon, mash potatoes and the strawberry ice cream. Everything was just as I dreamed! The chowder was creamy, but not too creamy, and the salmon was soft and perfectly cooked. The ice cream was good too, about two small scoops, but definitely more than enough to fill me after the meal. Everything was great besides the depressed hostesses!",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Great food and service.  Something should be done about the chaos at the hostess station.  It gets very crowded and is very off-putting.  Insisting that full parties be present before seating people is probably not a good idea.  Not only does it create the congestion in front, but it isn't a very nice way to treat folks who are about to spend a LOT of money in your restaurant.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"A very fancy place but very crowded and mainly people who come here are those in suits. We had reservation for 4 and they didn't seat us until everyone was here. We were given the regular menu and had to ask for the special menu, which we were given shortly without  any snobby look from our waiter. We were seated in the  Trylon Room, that's the glass structure room and it was beautiful. Lights were dimmed and very romantic. We ordered clam chowder and the field greens, for entrees the 14oz kono steak and another order the marinated beef steak (not on the menu shown on restaurant week .cOM) The 4 of us ordered 2 mash and 2 green beans and dessert the chocolate cake and the cheesecake. Clam chowder tasted like canned soup, the salad tasted like defrosted salad- very water down and dress was nothing special. The bread basket came shortly. Freshly baked goods- a whole grain w/ fruit and nut, a pretzel bread-like white bread, and a flat crispy 'roti'. The unique object here wasn't the bread but the butter. The butter came in a small dish side, it was not flavored but it had a creamy, milky melt in your mouth sensation. Note--this is not whipped airy butter, so let it sit in your mouth a while for it to melt. Our steaks came and all 3 were cooked perfectly at medium rare. The butter shallot sauce added a touch more flavor to the steak. I still thought it needed a bit more salt on it. The marinated beef came in two 3-4 oz each. The flavor of the marinated steak was a different cut from the kono so it tasted a bit better. The side dishes came in a small size metal platter that supposedly was for 2. We were surprised that it was very small, If we divided it up for 4 people, we probably got like 7 string bean for each person and 2 teaspoon of mashed. The mash was very watery consistence with skin in it and the green bean's sauce was good but the bean itself was a bit plain. Thank goodness for the steak that we were close to full. The desserts came, the chocolate flour less cake was sprinkled with coffee powder and the cheesecake was topped with a caramelized sugar coating, both with berries. The chocolate cake was a thick consistency of a mousse, with a semi sweet bitterness that for non sweet tooth, this is great. However, it was a bit heavy. The cheesecake itself wasn't too sweet even with the sugar glaze on top, it was a perfect bite. However, the strawberry sauce on the side didn't live up to its expectation and there was very little gram cracker crust. Overall, we sat there for almost 2 hours and our water always got refilled. We spent almost $50 each person for dinner.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Why do restaurants participate in restaurant week if they're not going to give customers a taste of their usual professionalism and gourmet food? I had read about Capital Grille somewhere and decided to try it out during restaurant week, but it was so disappointing, I ended up cancelling the remaining reservations I had made elsewhere. My biggest issue with restaurant week is how the waiters take it as a free pass to become lazy and aloof. As for the food, the salad was mediocre, the beef tenderloin was decent, and the creme brulee was back to being mediocre. My friend had asked for her steak to be cooked medium rare, but it came overcooked. The atmosphere is trendy and quite beautiful, but I would probably only be back for drinks by the bar.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"I had a pleasant and memorable dining experience here. I came to this restaurant as part of my graduation dinner with my family in May 2010. So, this review is a bit long overdue. However, I will never forget my graduation dinner. We had a reservation for 9 people. When we arrived, our party only had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. It was a nice surprise to find that the white-linen covered table had gold-flaked ""CONGRATULATIONS"" scattered all over the table. Our waiter then greeted our table with a warm smile. Prior to taking our orders, he had also surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne in light of the special occasion. We shared shrimp cocktail and lobster mac and cheese for appetizers. The majority of the table ordered the prime rib and Filet Mignon for our entrees, paired with a nice bottle of red wine.  My mother ordered the halibut. Considering how picky my mother is about food, she is the type of person who will first yell at you and then send a cooked piece of fish back to the kitchen. She had no complaints. We also ended the meal with chocolate cake, creme brulee, and a sorbet. It was all very appetizing, and I don't recall any mishaps during dinner. All I could remember was that it was a special night and Capital Grille was a part of it. The server was very attentive, and the setting of the restaurant seemed very intimate and appropriate for this occassion. I really enjoyed it.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"This is the essence of an old boy's club, complete with swanky Wall Street men grabbing drinks at the bar with clients and business deals being made in quiet corners over white table cloths. Lucky for me, it lived up to the hype and delivered a delicious steak that would make any man - or woman - very happy. I had the bone-in filet with truffle fries and it was all very good. Service was excellent, and the bartender was also on point - I enjoyed my old fashioned with a splash of amaretto. I will say this probably isn't the best place to come for a date night - it feels very corporate, and that's the crowd it caters to. However, if you're in the area meeting up with people after work or for a power lunch, this is a very solid place to go. Would definitely go back.",4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"Underwhelming.  Bottom Line - not awful but won't be going back. Went for restaurant week because the menu included a bone-in sirloin (vs. all the petite fillets everywhere else for restaurant week)  I've been trying to hit all the major steak places but this place never made the top of the list, so thought restaurant week was a good way to give it a try and see if it would earn the upgrade to a regular meal. It did not. First I had to go out of my way to ask for the restaurant week menu... poorly played Capital Grille, you're a chain, don't try and gilt me. Caesar salad came out, was fine, nothing noteworthy.  Also had shrimp cocktail, which was good but the shrimp were small. Steaks came out, ordered mine rare it was rare to medium/rare, which was just fine by me.  The gf ordered medium/rare and it came out medium to medium well... so of course lost a lot of flavor.  My steak, again properly cooked was solid but a notch or two below the best steakhouses (del frisco's, sparks etc) Desert was a mixed bag, flour less cake was terrible, ice cream was good. So overall, I wouldn't say no if I was a corporate account, but not going to spend my money here again.",3.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"Oftentimes, when I'm going to a restaurant with which I notice that it's a little pricey ($$$+), I have expectations that it's going to be great and that I will ultimately write a 4-star review.  Not here.  When I arrived, a few friends waiting at the bar ordered their signature cocktail, The Godfather - whiskey and amaretto.  So damn tasty, I'm going to ask every establishment I go to from now on what their signature cocktail is. When the full party arrived we were seated promptly at a corner table adjacent to the beautiful architectural metal and glass window adacent to a gentleman - Jacob Javits.  We politely asked for the restaurant week menu and they took back their ""newspaper"" sized menus without attitude.  Most of us got the bone-in sirloin and creamed spinach - all super tasty.  The shallot butter sauce on the steak was a heartstopper.  As an appetizer, I had the spinach but I had to taste my friend's clam chowder.  If you don't have a dietary restriction - go for that.  For sure. Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake which was a bit too intense for my tastebuds in terms of bitter-sweetness, so I would recommend a creme brulee instead next time. Bill came, and unlike most restaurants who'd normally charge a nominal 18% tip (esp for our party of 10), we were happy to give 20+%.  I also want to point out that when the food was coming, there were multiple waitstaff helping out with giving us food - one asked the other for help and he did.  No BS competition for tips or table assignment politics - just a great staff whom I'm sure are happy workers. Superb.  Highly recommended.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"It's funny, I've worked across the street from The Capital Grille for about five years now and not once did I ever bother going.  Often time, coworkers spoke of it as super mega expensive, which is primarily what kept me away.  However, when time came to choose a place to visit for Restaurant Week, Capital Grille earned my attention! I chose this location for its beautiful pyramid design at the base of the Chrysler Building.  It's a modern and exotic looking structure with a more traditional looking bar area.  The restaurant evokes a casual formality with its dark bar, dim interior but comfortable seating and large paintings of icons on the wall such as Jacob Javitz. I hung out at the bar a bit before getting seated and ordered my new 'go to' drink: The Godfather, a mixture of whiskey and amaretto.  Simple yet wonderfully dark and tasty.  All my friends enjoyed their drinks including their iconic signature drink: the Stoley Doley which is based on Vodka soaked pineapple, yum! Our service was really nice.  At first we were given regular menus and when we asked for the Restaurant Week menu, there was no sneering or looks from the staff, just happy service. I was very impressed. I ordered the salad appetizer which was very tasty.  Their dressing was sweet but had a tiny bit of bite.  For my entree, I ordered the 14oz bone in steak and threw in the lobster tail for $10 extra - and man was it worth it!  The steak was beautifully crusted and hot on the outside but nice and red on the inside, the way I like it!  The lobster was wonderfully seasoned and juicy all at the same time. For dessert, i had the creme brulee which had the requisite hard candy like shell on top and a deliciously creamy layer underneath.  I also tasted the chocolate espresso cake which was very powerful.  Normally these types of cakes lack the espresso flavor and just taste like chocolate, not so here!  This cake balanced both and really grabbed your taste buds. I am now intrigued and intend to return here for a dinner some time, Restaurant Week or no.  As you can see from the reviews by my buddies Tom K. and Albert Wl, I probably won't be alone!",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille
"If there were such a thing as the seat of government for a republic of steakhouses, I may have to nominate The Capital Grille. Unlike other steakhouses that maintain mostly a local footprint in NYC, The Capital Grille is a chain. For those who consider such a word taboo, think 24 karat gold chain as opposed to generic suburban American restaurant with button wearing staff. In other words, The Capital Grille demonstrates that expanding across the east coast and most of the country doesn't have to result in a decline in quality. I had already lunched at the Time Life Location so when an opportunity came about for dinner during Restaurant Week (now months) at the Chrysler Building spot, I was in. And this is a huge space! Once past the bar area, the tables unfold in a sea of white cloths surrounded by dark wood, paintings and global clocks. We were seated under a painting of the watchful eye of Jacob Javits, you know, the center guy. And even before diving into the food (Which I'd be happy to do again at 9:50am, the time I'm composing this review), I must comment on just how stellar the service was here. Aloof, patronizing staff who secretly scorn the flocks of RW enthusiasts? Not here! Courteous, smiling, and going the extra mile as demonstrated by walking me to the very cusp of the bathroom area (And this is no short walk!), the staff here made every minute one of refined comfort. A friend accidentally spilled her Stoli Doli (a signature cocktail of vodka and pineapples) and a waitstaff wizard flew in with a complimentary replacement. This is why 5 stars have to be administered: service with an efficient smile combined with epoch shattering goodness on my plate. 14 oz bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. No upgrade or supplemental fee required! (Take that, original nyc steakhouse in the downtown area!) A proper piece of meat, complete with bone, to add to the Fred Flintstone experience. While a white napkin establishment, the temptation was great to revert to the primordial mean of hand grabbing slobbering caveman behavior. I refrained and opted for the civilized knife method. But what is Kona? It's Hawaiian coffee that adds a unique flavor to the rub. And let's not forget the shallot butter, enhancing the already flavorful steak but also serving as a fine place to dip the additional lobster tail. Yes, for $10 more I created my own surf and turf. Now this wasn't a gigantic tail by any means but it was satisfying. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes that once again demonstrated RW menu pricing with non-RW sized portions. So creamy, I gladly finished my wife's potatoes as she lapsed into a food coma. (that still hasn't lifted 12 hours later) Chocolate espresso cake was the final act and this by now war torn stuffed band of eaters took their best effort at mopping up the sugary caffeinated treat. The Capital Grille was a capital choice for a restaurant week finale. It's the kind of place that is clearly upscale but doesn't shove it in your face. Clearly that gets my vote!",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

It had been a while since I've been to this location. First thing first - just because it is a chain restaurant doesn't mean it doesn't have the same standards as boutique restaurants or michelin star restaurants. I'm not saying that it's along the lines of eleven madison park however the quality of service and food ranks it pretty high up on my list of restaurants. I've been to the Capital Grille in FIDI and I was extremely impressed. I hoped to get the same experience in the Midtown East location and I did. Our server was extremely attentive and when we had to wait for one of our side dishes even though it was maybe an additional 10 minutes waiting - our server gave us the side dish on the house. My friends and I ordered some steaks and the lobster mac and cheese. I had my steak done rare plus - and rare plus it was. The center of my steak was still cold. Word of advice - get medium rare unless you like cold steak. That's the main reason why I had to deduct a star. The mash potatoes on the side was exactly like the FIDI location. Smooth and velvety - just the right tinge of salt and pepper. I still think I prefer the FIDI location just a tad bit more because it is slightly more intimate than this location. However one thing for sure - this chain restaurant still lives up to its name. ~happy eating!!,4.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

"RESTAURANT WEEK is so worth it here. I felt so bloated after dining here. They offer 14 oz steak, which is just the most incredible deal you can get in the city during restaurant week. On top of that, an starter, side AND dessert was included, so it was definitely worth your money. Got the salad which was meh, huge portion though. Side was creamed spinach which isn't that bad, dessert was probably most disappointing. I got the creme brulee and was excited to crack the layer. Alas, there was no satisfying crack, but instead, the spoon went straight to the creamy layer. Also did the generous pour offer, which was basically a small wine tasting deal. Server was very generous with the pour and ended up leaving the place happy and a bit tipsy. Will go back to splurge one day, couldn't order the lobster mac and cheese because I was too full. The interior design is also appealing, if you can, ask to be seated near the glass panes, it offers a nice view during the sunset.",5.0,"155 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017",The Capital Grille

Perhaps our server was overworked, but the four of us were forgotten. The plates stayed on our table 45 minutes after we ended our entrees. We finally caught the attention of another waiter who was passing by and asked him to get our waitress. Instead, the manager came over, cleared the table and took our coffee and dessert order.

"This was a solid Steakhouse for a group of 8 people. It wasn't terribly busy at 7:30 on a Friday so we could have found a table for more people. One of my friends got a porterhouse and he loved it. We got two crab cakes, two spinach, 2 calamari appetizers, and two truffle fries, two lobster mac. This was the perfect amount of appetizers and sides. Note to self make sure to go for the $100 bottles of wine. I got one that was $80 and even though it was rated + 90 you could tell the difference. I got the New York strip which was 14 ounces. Next time I'm going to the filet mignon. I think I would like that better because it would be more tender and it was 10 oz. This place was close to Times Square so it was nice to walk around there afterwards. But it was a far walk from Penn Station. I would just take the 320 bus from Secaucus to Port Authority.

I am in Michigan, and was tasked with finding an appropriate diner venue for my boss to host 15 high-profile investment advisors for dinner, the night before their meeting, in proximity to the meeting venue and hotels. The Capital Grille fit that bill. They have a variety of accommodations for private dining, which made it easy to find one that fit our needs perfectly. The rooms are elegant, yet comfortable. The private dining manager was responsive and making arrangements from afar was a breeze. I could see the details of the rooms online, which was very helpful. We were able to choose a set price per guest and even choose the wine ahead of time. The menu choices were excellent and decadent. The room cost requirements were appropriate for the size of the party/room and reasonable.

"So I came here to grab sometime to eat while I was at Rockefeller Center and Radio City doing the Xmas thing. Wanted a place to get a good meal and a cocktail  and it was a block walking distance away. This place has a bar area and a fancy upscale dining area in the back. I was in casual clothing dressed for cold weather so I wouldn't have even thought to try and sit in the dining area so I found a place at the bar. The bar was pretty busy and had a WallStreet feel to it as far at the people that was there. I felt like I was around tons of men who trade stocks and buy real estate lol . I was tended to right away by Mike the bartender who was fantastic and super friendly . He explained the menu to me and made suggestions that ended up being right on and I loved what I got. Cocktail... had the Stoli Doli which is their signature cocktail.... pineapple infused vodka . $15 but nice and strong.  Also tried some Cabernet wine from Paso Robles that went excellent with my meal Soup- the Porcini Mushroom Bisque was EXCELLENT . I mean - I know I will dream of this and want to come back for this! :) mike recommend the steaks here... most of them were super large portions so he recommended me trying the sliced filet mignon with mushrooms, onions with fig essence. The meat was excellent even tho I am more of a ribeye kinda gal - and this was 10oz vs the other options that were like 16oz and more. I ended up sampling their flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. Both were really good. And I'm not a cheesecake person at all but this cheesecake was like wow. I read about the lobster Mac and cheese which is one of my favorite sinful foods ...

"I'm a fan of the Capital Grille without regard for the city I am in; I have very, very rarely not had an optimal experience. But, this particular location deserves an individual review. I made an advance reservation by phone. The agent I spoke with was polite. And, when I called back, twice, to alter my reservation, she maintained her hospitable demeanor. The day before, I also received an accommodating reminder with the same professional and friendly tone. On arrival, the exterior location was under construction, but that did not interfere. The interior had the expected classy decor. Our hostess was ready for us at the front and we were immediately led to a private booth. Anthony, our outstanding server, arrived in seconds offering us menus and drink options. He presented the evening specials and because of the later hour, (9:45 pm), was able to hesitate at our table and briefly chat. Service and hospitality at its finest! As always, the flatbread and rolls on the table are fresh-baked. Though I was set on ordering the porterhouse, as I always do, I went off my plan and chose the remarkably underpriced special, Twin South African Lobster Tails. My dinner companion went for the Filet, from which I shared a healthy portion. Both the surf and the turf were precisely broiled to perfection. The advertised 10oz lobster serving was monstrous; enough for 2 with some left over. And, quite the bargain at $54.00!!! The Filet had a perfect char with a juicy, pink center. Combined with the sides of mushrooms and the most homey mashed potatoes, we had a perfect dinner. Somehow, Anthony coerced us to order, and finish, a healthy slice of the classic flourless chocolate cake. This is a long-respected establishment with predictably high standards for food and service.

I ordered the Filet Mignon With Mashed Potatoes and Lobster Mac & Cheese. The Mac & Cheese wasn't my favorite but the Filet Mignon definitely was (I've had MANY from steakhouses everywhere, this was my far the top 5!) I loved the ambiance, the customer service and the food! Can't wait to eat here again!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Having been here twice, once for a lunch and the other for a dinner, I'd say that I've had better. The location on 42nd Street is better than this one - this location might be a bit overrated. The fam and I went for Restaurant Week. The herb roasted chicken was really dry, as was the halibut that my cousin ordered. I get it, who goes to Capital Grille for anything other than steak, but whatever...The lobster mac and cheese is solid, but not enough to redeem the meal. The calamari app is awesome, though. I've had better. Judging off both of my experiences, maybe it's better as a lunch option than a dinner one.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"AMAZING EXPERIENCE! 5 STARS+++ Thank you Joey for your warm welcome and allowing us to move our reservation at the last minute. Thank you Tyrell for what I haven't stopped raving about; your stellar service, your wonderful suggestions, your attentiveness, and extensive knowledge of everything on the menu. We can't wait to come back. Here are some highlights and tips: Bread: We didn't eat as much as we could have as we were awaiting our meal. We did manage to have what I believe to be a pumpernickel with raisins and nuts - so so good Lobster mac & cheese: order it! Full of lobster claws, just the right amount of bread crumbs and noodles perfectly cooked Salmon: Perfectly cooked ""well done"" as we requested. Spinach: excellent Apple dessert - yummy, perfectly flaky Decor & Attire:  There were patrons in jeans and sports jackets and some with their Sunday best. Overall a great dining experience and a wonderful night out. Sorry no time for pictures. Great for couples, dates, families - I wouldn't take small or young children.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I went here to celebrate my husbands birthday with another couple and we had the best experience. I had made reservations and actually arrived late for it and they had no problem accommodating us.

"This is by far the greatest restaurant I have eaten at here in NYC I walked in expecting to feel out of place here but you really feel welcome, I ordered a filet mignon and the greatest mashed potatoes I have ever had, it's a bit pricey... ok a lot pricey but it's worth it get the chocolate cake for desert, I will come back for special occasions.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

Started out with a bowl of the lobster bisque.  Big chunks of lobster, hot and yummy.  The calamari wasn't great.  It was breaded but soggy.  That was our only disappointment.  I had the porcini rib eye with aged balsamic vinigar which was perfect.  Delicious.   My husband had the tenderloin with two lobster tales.  Both steaks were perfectly cooked.  Sides of wild mushrooms and aspagus.  Cheesecake for dessert was yummy and nicely presented.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"How have I never reviewed this place? I've been here at least a doze times, and I almost always have a good experience. The only time it was kinda wonky was when we had a party of 7-8 in one of the private dining rooms, and the waiters kept forgetting about us, but other than that, it's solid. We were here about a week ago again to take advantage of the theater menu, which they have between I think 4-7pm everyday. You get to choose a starter, an entree, a side, and a dessert for I believe $42 or $45 or something around there. This is an incredible value, because that's how much a single steak can cost if you get it a la carte. My go-to is the clam chowder (def worth a taste if you haven't tried it before), the kona crusted steak (my fave!), and the creme brulee - altho I do prefer the cheesecake (I think you can pay a little more and get it instead of the creme brulee). Overall, I think it's a solid meal for the price. It may not be the best steakhouse in the entire world, but what I love about coming here is that they are consistent and consistently good. I know what to expect, and they always deliver. Other items of note: Lobster mac and cheese: tastes good, but the amount of lobster is inconsistent sometimes - but when you get a good dose, so worth it. Bread basket: brown bread with raisins is my favorite, but all the other stuff is good too! I basically get full before the appetizers even arrive. Fried Calamari: they pan fry it and stir in pickled peppers, and it's a great combination. Sometimes it can be a bit oily b/c of the pan fry. Truffle Fries: I think they have some parmesan on these too. No real truffles - just truffle oil, but it's still good!",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Probably one of the best restaurants you can go to - whether you are in Tampa, New York, Las Vegas or anywhere.  Consistently a fine dining experience, with great wines and top notch service.  Steaks are just to die for, and the salmon is great.   Sides - they are all done perfectly.    Just one of the best chain of restaurants that exists. The pinnacle of a fine dining chain.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Of all the steak houses at my disposal in NYC I decided to try this one for my birthday, ( 2/25/18 ) for its menu and extensive wine list. I chose a 2013 Continuum (by Tim Mondavi ) at a mere $330.00 to start the celebration. Perfection in a bottle,try it if you can. I opened with the Lobster Bisque (with a very nice portion of real lobster meat ), now that's how to make Lobster Bisque. Too many restaurants add too many ingredients that deflect you away from  the desired taste...LOBSTER. Nicely done here. I ordered the ""Chef's Suggestion"", a sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions,and wild Mushrooms, in an absolute mouth watering reduction sauce. Cooked to perfection at ""Medium"".  The usual Creamed Spinach and Mashed Potatoes were nicely done too. Now I prefer to save some of my Cab to go with desert, and in doing so I ordered the perfect accompaniment , a Flourless Chocolate Espresso cake ! ( with some fresh whipped cream on the side, of course ). I would have rated this a 100/100 except for the fact that the waitress dripped some of my choice wine on the table,and my sleeve, as she withdrew the bottle after pouring my glass.( Somebody teach her to twist the bottle counter-clockwise as you lift ), unless you expect me to suck on my sleeve to get all my fermented grape juice  :) So we'll give it a 99/100 and 5 STARS.  Highly recommend.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"It's never my preference to eat at expensive chain restaurants, least of all when I'm on vacation. I guess my latest visit to New York was technically a work trip, which is why I ended up spending one of my evenings at the Midtown West Capital Grille. I'm one of many lawyers who decided, ""Fuck the law, I'm gonna write books (and also Yelp reviews)."" I got an invite to speak on a lawyers-who-write panel for a bar association conference in New York a couple weeks back, and I met with my fellow panelists for dinner the night before the event. The dinner wasn't covered, and I was a bit confused when the organizer informed me that he'd booked a private room at the Capital Grille. He noted there was a food and beverage minimum for the room, and that I was expected to put in $100 for my share. This all seemed pretty unnecessary for a party of five, as well as a wasted opportunity for a group of people visiting this great food city from different parts of the country. To make things worse, I'd already planned a late second dinner with friends, and was only going to meet my co-panelists for drinks. I showed up ready to have a bad time. As soon as I walked into the room, I understood. Turns out I was not just the only woman and non-white person on this panel, I was also the youngest by a few decades, and the only one who hadn't written a presidential biography. The organizer was a lovely Texan man who said there was a Capital Grille in Dallas, and it was always reliable. Everyone ordered the filet. Once my resentment evaporated, I had a lot of fun. We were in the Phillip Johnson room, and it was quite pleasant, quiet and comfortable with a round table big enough for about a party of eight. Service was attentive and professional. Our waitress checked in on us at regular intervals, and we were never wanting for anything. I didn't eat a full meal here, but I did get a half dozen oysters, and they were good, fresh and tasty, served with mignonette on ice. Mostly, I drank. I had a couple glasses of red wine, as well as a cocktail and a pour of Courvoisier (we had to reach that minimum). All very nice. The cocktail was a twist on an Old Fashioned called the In Fashion, made with Russell's Reserve 10-year small batch bourbon, Grand Marnier, and black walnut bitters, served over an orange ice sphere with an amarena cherry. Thanks to the New York law requiring chain restaurants to display calorie counts on the menu, I now know that an Old Fashioned is about 220 calories. Good to know, I guess. I was in a great mood by the end of this dinner. My dining companions were friendly and fascinating, and I was pleasantly tipsy. There are definitely better places to eat for $100 a head in New York City, but if you want the comfort of a private room in midtown, I guess you could do worse.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I came here with my Boo Boo and her bro on a Friday during restaurant week. We had reservation and were seated once we got there. We had the clam chowder or the Cesar salad to start. We each got the NY strip as our entrees and creme brulee or flourless espresso cake. We shared the truffle fries. Our waitress comped us the fires because she forgot the order. The service and food was great. The generous pour deal was really good. For $28, you can get 7 glasses of different wines. I chose only reds so I had a more generous pour of 4 glasses of reds. Our waitress was very attentive and did a super job. TCG imo is one of the better steakhouse chains that I can trust will always provide good quality food and service. So, glad I was driven home.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"The Capital Grille on 51st Street is certainly one of the best restaurants in the city. I certainly love coming before or after a performance on Broadway. The menu revolves around the delicious steak, but is much more than that. The other meats and seafood are also amazing. My first time here was magnificent. We had just come from a performance of Wicked on Broadway and were looking forward to our meal here. Immediately as we entered, my friend and I were impressed with the beautiful decor and the friendliness of the hosts and hostesses in front. We were promptly seated at a lovely table with an impressive menu. The wine list was also excellent, and the cocktails quite nice as well. I ordered the shrimp cocktail for my appetizer. Shrimp cocktail is one of my favorite things to order at a new restaurant that I am visiting. I was certainly not disappointed. The shrimp were plump and juicy, with a perfectly spicy cocktail sauce. We also ordered a Caesar salad. It was perfect, with beautifully dressed, fresh lettuce. For the entree I had to go with the house specialty, the steak. I ordered the fourteen ounce New York strip. It was just what you would except from a place like this. Juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It was also incredibly tender. Overall, impeccable. My friend also had steak and loved it as well. To go along with the steaks we ordered the parmesan truffle fries and grilled asparagus. The potatoes were perfectly done, and the flavors were spot-on. The asparagus was great and served with lemon mosto, which gave it a nice taste. For dessert I had to go with the double chocolate cake. It was spectacular. Served warm just the way I like it, with creamy, fresh ice cream. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive and courteous. The waiters and waitresses made sure everything was to our liking. These standards have been the same every time that I have been back, either for lunch or dinner. I certainly had an excellent time at this wonderful establishment. I urge you to go as soon as you can, it will be delicious. The locations on Wall Street and 42nd Street are just as good.

"2017 Restaurant Week Lunch Review Decent spot for RW Lunch. Service at the bar is a little all over the place but luckily the food comes out very quickly - letting you get in an out in under 40 minutes. Here's a rundown of the food: Complimentary bread basket - pretty good. The dinner rolls are piping hot and crispy. The crisp bread/cracker is meh. Served with butter. Clam Chowder - I liked this. Nice and creamy with a decent amount of seafood chunks. Dry Aged Sirloin - cooked perfectly but still a bit chewy. The arugula salad was surprisingly fantastic and I normally hate arugula. Espresso Cake - I liked this a lot. I believe its ""flourless"" so its not a traditional cake texture. It tastes more like a candy bar. Good stuff Overall an average experience",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"For a chain, Capital Grille is always a solid choice.  I have enjoyed visits to other locations of CG and this one did not disappoint. The restaurant looks like you would expect a steakhouse to look only it's not quite as noisy or as testosterone-y.   I was seated upstairs which was actually nice and a bit calmer than the main floor. Service was friendly and professional.  I started with crabcakes (delicious!) and ordered the NY Strip medium rare.   The steak was terrific.  Very tender and flavorful but I couldn't finish it!  For sides, my buddy and I split the mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts.  Both very good, with lots of bacon in the sprouts. I was too full for dessert. You'll want to make sure your wallet is full because my appetizer and steak alone totalled $70.   But that's about on par for steakhouses in midtown so I can't complain.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

At first was offered an odd location of a table which I don't think they should place ( near kitchen entry ) especially when I had a reservation but let's get down to the positive . They quickly placed us elsewhere and where we took the opportunity to eat from the RW menu. We ordered yummy cosmopolitans and Jumbo crab cakes in addition to RW options.

Capital Grille is one of the best steak chains. They do everything right. There is no ordering bad everything is wonderful and they have high standards thus 5 stars. Was invited for a business dinner as we were a group of 28 not easy to find a restaurant to accommodate such a large group. Originally we were scheduled for another restaurant that I was looking forward to but it was explained to me our group was too big not only did we get our own room on the second floor it was open to the entire restaurant so you got to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. This restaurant was in walking distance from our hotel the Hilton in midtown. Upon arriving we waited about 10 minutes in the lobby until we were lead to our tables. One round and one long table I preferred the round so I could talk to everyone at our table. We had several servers specially designated to our party. Fantastic service as we never went without anything not even for a second. We had a beautifully set menu for our group with more choices and food that one could even eat or drink. We started with seafood towers OMG do they do this right wonderful assortment of the freshest and coldest seafood. Just the way it should be I had one oversized shrimp and I was in heaven. Also the crab was fantastic. Other appetizers were crab cakes another favorite. Our salads were fantastic majority of us had the greens with the roasted Brussels sprouts. Main course if you have the opportunity get the Chilean Sea Bass in short supply so get it while you can before it is extinct. Also they prepare it the best in the world. My portion was gorgeous and so big yes I had to take it with me for a late night snack. For dessert creme brûlée a classic light and always served with the freshest of seasonal berries.

The crab cakes, Brussels sprouts, and lobster Mac n cheese are addicting and can stand as a meal on their own.

I also like that the tables aren't one on top of another and you can't hear a complete strangers conversation. Our waiter and server were really nice and engaging, which made the overall experience that much better. To eat, I had the salmon with mashed potatoes for dinner and the crème brûlée for dessert.

I dined with a friend and we shared the lamb rib chops, the lobster mac and cheese, and the caesar salad. All were absolutely delicious! One cool thing about this place is that when you're ordering drinks, they bring over an iPad and you can swipe through their cocktails and wine list. Each drink has its own page where you can see a picture of the drink and its ingredients. If you're looking for wines, you can filter the selections to make your choice easy. Very helpful!

"Tonight was my first time dining at The Capital Grille and I really loved it! We ordered off of the Theatre menu, which was $39 with your choice of a soup/salad, a main entree, an accompaniment, and a dessert. This was a great price because the portions were big and the food was delicious. The restaurant is classy and modern and the ambience is nice, with dim lighting and a quiet atmosphere. There is a bar in the front of the restaurant that looked like a perfect place to grab cocktails with friends. We were seated at a lovely booth and greeted immediately by our waitress. She was excellent throughout the night. The Theatre Menu choices were: Soup/Salad: *Field Greens *Caesar Salad *Cup of Clam Chowder Entrée: *8 oz. Filet Mignon *Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin *Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon *Double Cut Lamb Chop Ribs Accompaniments: *Mashed Potatoes *Fresh Creamed Spinach Dessert: *Creme Brûlée *Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake *Trio of Handmade Ice Creams *Seasoned Fruit Sorbets We Ordered: Soup/Salad: *Caesar Salad - It was nothing special but the portion was nice. I was expecting a small, side-order portion but this one was like an entrée. I did love the fresh greens and freshly grated cheese. Entrées: *Seared Salmon - I loved it. The salmon was cooked with a light citrus glaze and accompanied with green beans. I liked it because it was light and healthy. The portion was also big, so I ended up taking it home. I highly recommend this dish. *Kona Crusted Sirloin with Shallot Butter - My friends ordered this and enjoyed it. They also couldn't finish it and took it home.  This comes highly recommended as well!! Dessert: *Creme Brûlée - Yummmm. Topped with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries, I loved it! *Flourless Chocolate Cake - Recommend this if you're a chocolate lover. It is dense but not too sweet. Try it it you like chocolate. *Trio of Homemade Ice Creams - This wasn't a fave of ours. There was a little aftertaste with some of the flavors that was a little different. Won't be ordering this again. I must add that the bread basket was quite impressive. There were at least five or more different types of breads to try and all were delicious. It was an overall excellent dining experience! I am an out-of-town visitor and I love when I find new restaurants that I enjoy.

"My friends and I met for a restaurant week dinner, but we enjoyed our time there so much oru $42 three-course dinner turned into a $110 dinner with wine and additional sides. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food was wonderful. Most of us had the filet mignon, which was $49 on the regular menu. Coupled with au gratin potatoes (extra), Sam's mashed potatoes, and green beans, it was a classic steakhouse dinner for sure. Let's put it this way: I didn't even mind my umbrella smashing to bits while walking to the restaurant in that rainstorm, that's how good the meal wound up to be!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

It is quite dark inside, but the service, wine and food was gorgeous. (The company was alright I suppose) (Joke) Had a lovely steak which in all honesty I haven't ever really enjoyed until I came to New York City. I do jump on a daily basis between eating meat, being vegetarian and being vegan, so I don't have meat more than twice a week, if that. However, the steak in NYC really is worth a try!

Visited this Capital Grille location for the first time (have been to the Wall St location a number of times) and very much enjoyed their Restaurant Week menu.

"*This is a restaurant week rating* -New England Clam Chowder soup was not good, extremely runny and watery. -Wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon is definitely the better choice for the appetizer. The blue cheese dressing was yummy and so were the bacon pieces. -Filet Mignon  was average at best. They couldn't get my temperature right, I ordered medium well and the steak came out medium rare. The actual cut of meat wasnt the best either, this was the first time I experienced fat on my filet mignon. Not impressed. -Sides: mashed potatoes, they were pretty good. String beans: average, nothing to brag or complain about. Creamed Spinach (we ordered this as an extra), did not like it at all, it had a weird taste. Other people at my table said they enjoyed it but I personally didn't find it to be appetizing. -Chocolate Espresso Cake: very rich and heavy, first few bites were enjoyable but after that I was done with it. We decided to do the ""generous pour"" for $28 extra per person. It's supposed to come with 7 tastings of wine but we did 3 glasses instead. I think this was a good deal and would recommend giving it a try. The generosity of the pours is based on who is serving you, our waiter was pretty generous for the most part. Based on this experience, i would not reccommend coming here for restaurant week. I do feel if I came outside of restaurant week, my experience would be better. Not sure if I'll ever get around to giving it another try, simply because there are so many other awesome steakhouses in the city.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

The restaurant week food itself was good, but once I told them we were celebrating a special occasion, they went the extra mile to really make it special! The table was decorated with fake flower petals and a greeting card as a nice touch. They also gave us complimentary champagne for the table! The food itself was quite good, we tried the steak and the burger and both were cooked exactly as requested and fairly tasty. The dessert was a chocolate cake, and again for the special occasion, they gave an extra dessert with a candle in it and 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate.

"*2.5 - Following a day in the city the week after Christmas (Dec. 28) we came to Capital Grille for dinner. Despite arriving about 10 minutes before our reservation, we were seated in just a few minutes in the back by the wine cellar which was a beautiful, private feeling spot. Edgar was our primary server. At TCG, they've switched to an electronic menu for the wine which is sometimes nice if the software is user friendly but in this case it was not. We asked for a hard paper copy of the wine list for easier searching, but TCG has gone all digital with wine - no more paper lists. Though the food menus are paper. After attempting to search for a good wine by the glass, we went with ordering a cocktail instead. To start, we ordered the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad with aged Balsamic and the field greens salad with tomatoes, fresh herbs and a Parmesan vinaigrette. The greens salad was nice and refreshing but a tad overdressed. As for the mozzarella salad, we remarked that it was ok but nothing exceptional as well as the mozzarella wasn't as creamy as one would expect it to be. Shortly after our appetizers were cleared, we got our entrees; double cut lamb rib chops and the sesame-seared tuna for me. Cutting through the middle of the lamb chops, we could easily tell that they were not right. Of the four, only one was done correctly and another semi correct. So while they may have not been to the point of being inedible, we had higher expectations for TCG. My tuna, which was sushi-grade was correctly properly and the gingered rice was nice and fluffy. The tuna came with three different ""sauces"" as our waiter explained it in small individual dishes. Of the three, only one tasted right for the tuna. Overall, our recent experience here was fine. Nothing awful but for a steakhouse, the restaurant/chef should know better how to even cook several lamb chops and, as with any hospitable restaurant, patrons should not feel as though their server is trying to run them out of it. I wouldn't say he wasn't attentive but rather he was a little rough and insincere. At the end when we were deciding between the two of us whether to stay for another drink or go somewhere else, he quickly swooped up the menu and said ""Ok, so then you're all right?"" and left before we could even have a chance to respond.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Tonight we feasted while at a work-related dinner which was held at the midtown chapter of The Capital Grille.  The hostess who greeted us prompt, friendly, and immediately took our coats as we walked in.  She then led us to the back room where the wait staff was ready to help find our seats, as well as fill our glasses with wine.  For starters, we had the spicy, jalapeño calamari which was cooked perfectly!  The texture of the calamari itself was not overly chewy and the crunch of the batter was impressive.  The pickled jalapeños and peppers added a nice kick to the dish, but my only complaint is that the texture of the pickled peppers was too limp in comparison to the fried calamari.  I wanted each bite to have that vinegary element, but every time I placed both pieces of food in my mouth, I was so disappointed from a texture perspective - of the peppers.  I may have enjoyed them more if they were crunchier. The table bread came in a variety of rolls and sliced sourdough breads that were pipping hot - perfect for the salted butter to melt into a liquid gold onto the starchy bread.  The roll had a perfect crisp to the outer shell, but a soft, dense, and chewy middle.  The salad that came was a mixed fricassee, romaine lettuce, and mixed greens plate that came with three different types of tomatoes, and the dressing was maybe a Caesar dressing that wasn't overly apparent on the dish, which I liked. For the main course, I had the 18 ounce bone-in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter.  I definitely had leftovers of the perfectly cooked medium steak which was accompanied by a wilted piece of greens.  The presentation of the dish was not that impressive, but the melted butter on top glistened the perfectly charred piece of meat.  For sides, we had Sam's mashed potatoes which were DELICIOUS!  Almost comparable to Jacob's Pickles's mash potatoes because they were hot, buttery, and gooey in consistency.  The steamed broccoli was simple and with the exception of the mash potatoes, the meat and broccoli were not salted which I liked because it is healthier.  However, from a taste perspective, the meat definitely needed more salt.  That being said, I would rather have under-salted food than overly salty, which is not pleasant at all! Dessert included three different dishes (brownie cake, Brûlée style cheesecake, and the coconut cream pie with house made caramel sauce).  The last dish was AMAZING and quite addicting.  The pie's tart was moist and buttery.  The custard and cream on top harmoniously joined together with the shortbread-like crust.  The butter cookie on top was also tasty and added a nice crunch to the overall dish.  I enjoyed it thoroughly with my chamomile tea. Service was fantastic - our servers were attentive to our needs and kept our glasses filled with wine, water, and tea.  They were polite and opened our doors for us as well, as we exited.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"What a classy place! One of the best steak house experiences I've ever had. We had a nice private booth - I had a view of the kitchen - great to see the hustle and bustle of the action behind the scenes. Our waitress and the buss boys were so friendly and attentive. Starting off we went with one of our favorites lump crab cocktail - such a good choice it was the biggest portion we've ever been served the lump crab went all the way to the bottom of the metal container it was served in - the meat fresh, sweet and so plump! My husband said his porcini dry rubbed and aged rib eye was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten - I tried a small piece and it was cooked to perfection - a beautiful crust from that rub - it melted in your mouth. I ordered the seared tenderloins with the butter poached lobster tails. Now this is where I take one star off. The lobster tails were totally overcooked - for this to be one of the priciest dishes on their menu it should of been perfection. The lobster in the mac and cheese was cooked better (PS: The mac and cheese is a MUST order!)

"A great choice for business lunch or dinner near Rockefeller Center. As Capital Grille's usually are, this one is cavernous and inviting in the old school boys club kind of way. A large bar and wall of private wine cubbies greets you if you enter on 51st, but you can also enter from within the lobby of the Time Life building. Grab a booth table if you can since they're roomy and cozy. It's never too loud, but with the right level of din to hold serious, or not-so-serious, conversations. The food here is consistently good and on par with the other locations. They're obviously famous for their steaks but I also like their fish dishes. The salmon with Marcona almonds was fantastic. Oh and don't miss the truffle fries, they're fantastic!

But it is Restaurant Week, so they were busy -- There is a huge tip bowl at the coat room with suggestive $5 bills. A little tacky me thinks. Only restaurant in New York that we visited where the tip bowl was so offensively in-your-face. There's plenty of room in the restaurant for you to put your coats (we got a booth), so try to forgo the obnoxiousness. Steak was a little tough but you could taste the beef flavor. They served what was on the menu, really liked the bacon bits that came with the Wedge salad.

"This is a restaurant week 2017 review: My boyfriend and I always try and take advantage of nyc restaurant week, is it is often a way to try some more expensive restaurants at a more affordable price point. We try and really do our homework to avoid going places that aren't a good restaurant week value. We have both heard good things about the capital grille, and with the average steak costing about $40-$50 (not including any sides) we thought restaurant week was the perfect time to try. We were not disappointed. The first course we got the Cesar salad and the wedge. We both preferred the wedge, the thick cut bacon on it was fantastic. The Cesar was good but it was your basic Cesar salad. The bread basket they give you is phenomenal. It comes with a variety of breads, we both wanted to eat the onion focaccia one forever. We both got the dry aged ny strip for our entree with the mashed potatoes. The steak was perfectly medium rare and so incredibly delicious. We got one of each dessert,  chocolate flourless cake and cremebrulee. I love cremebrulee and this one was great. I think looking back we would have just gotten two of those (the chocolate cake was good but very rich after a big meal. We had a wonderful experience. The decor was beautiful and staff was friendly.

To our surprise, they had some space and seated us in one of their private dining rooms on the second floor. The decor was warm, friendly, and very well kept. This is definitely a place that if not jacket required, it's you'd feel weird if you didn't have a jacket. To celebrate, a few of us got some drinks--hefty prices but not unexpected in midtown. For entrees, three of us got steaks, two got the salmon salad, one for the sea bass and one got the citrus salmon. For dessert, we shared the sorbet, crime brûlée and warm chocolate cake. Everything was fantasist. Beautifully seasoned, great flavor and had excellent presentation. The graduation girl got the filet mignon with caramelized onions and mushrooms and those mushrooms might have been the best mushrooms I ever had in my life! Our desserts were wonderful--I'm a big fan of crime brûlée and this one did not disappoint. Our waitress was very attentive throughout.

Made reservations about a week in advance and a day ago I heard about another special they were offering called the generous pour featuring 8 different wines from female wine makers for an amazing $28. Hey..I like wine and 8 being more than I usually enjoy during one meal I was up for the challenge! Service: I normally rate food first as I feel it's the most important but in this case our waiter Robert really made the visit special. Explained the full menu plus the Restaurant Week choices fully and made excellent suggestions. Suggested the perfect wine pairings from the salad through the dessert course, perfect service!!! Food: We were very fortunate to be here during restaurant week. $38 for a salad, entree, side dish, and dessert was quite a bargain at this establishment. Our party ordered the Caesar Salad, the classic Wedge Salad, Filet Mignon, Grilled Salmon and based on Robert's recommendation, I upgraded my dry aged sirloin to the Kona Bone In Dry Aged sirloin. The food was excellent, if I were in private I would have been gnawing the meat off that sirloin bone! The generous pour...Robert matched the wine perfectly with my courses and were a bargain at $28. Robert even refreshed my Syrah because it paired well with my dessert! Atmosphere: Classy, classic, elegant, but we did not feel like it was a stuffy establishment. Great feel and the people actually make it feel very warm. Value: Pricey but what a great deal with Restaurant Week. We again feel very fortunate and pleased to have had a chance to dine here. Overall: Wonderful establishment, one of my new favorites!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and I would say it was a very sweet celebration! I made a reservation with them days before and told them it was a birthday dinner so once we arrived, our table was ready for us with confetti spread out and a birthday card wishing him a great time! It was really cute! The waiter was very nice and polite and was there to check up on us every so often. My boyfriend ordered steak, and I got black cod and risotto! The steak was absolutely amazing! It was cooked perfectly! Every bite was sensational. My fish tasted great, however the risotto was way too salty for our liking. We got it switched twice and ended up with a side of mashed potatoes instead. The manager was very accommodating to our wishes and ended up taking the dish off our check! I had a lovely time here and would definitely come back here again!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"This was hands down one of the worst steakhouse experience I've had in NYC. Service:  the waitress was rude and inattentive. When we were ordering, we started to discuss the menu items and she would be impatient and kept asking whether she should come back. After the food arrives, one of the side was sent incorrectly. But we couldn't find her and tell her that. She didn't stop by and ask how's the food etc until 40 minutes later we caught her walking beside us (walking pass, with no intention to stop) And when she found out it was wrong, she did not apologize. Food:   We ordered a porterhouse steak. Steak was bland. Not much flavor. Sides of brussels sprouts too sweet. The French onion soup and the lobster crab cake were also only mediocre. I don't know how they get such a high yelp rating. I can't imagine this place even surviving in the competitive landscape of NYC.",1.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Much better options elsewhere.   Both of our steaks were cooked wrong (ordered medium and the centers were cold and raw.  I ate around the Center and left 3 pieces of the RAW meat on my plate.  A manager came by to ask if we were enjoying our meal.  I pointed out to her that our steaks were not cooked right and I showed her the pieces on my plate.  She then asked if I would like her to ""flash"" the last 3 pieces and bring them back.  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, the steak was fair, the bread basket was fantastic but the sides and soup were poor.  The string beans were drowned in butter, the mashed potatoes were just awful in texture and over salted.  We ordered martinis and while mine was filled to the top, my wife's was filled 3/4 of the way.  The shrimp add on my wife selected were 5 very small shrimp on a wood skewer that were over cooked and tasteless.  My ""crock"" of French  onion soup was a very small cup for $11 and nothing special.  The wedge salad was awful.  The bacon tasted old and was chewy and the dressing was not good at all.  The desserts were delicious which is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars.  We will never come back!",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"We are huge Capital Grille fans, having eaten in NYC, Dallas, Fort Worth and DC-Dallas regularly. Have to say this one was not up to their standards in food and service. We had two people waiting on us and it wasn't clear who was responsible. Shrimp cocktail arrived with no plates and entrees less than five minutes later and plates never came. Steaks over cooked, didn't complain, but was never asked if they were to our liking. Asked for bread twice before it came when we were almost through with our meal. At these prices, food and service should be much better. Plates finally cleared and no offer of coffee or dessert until I already had my card out to pay.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

I figured a good steakhouse is an excellent way to end the evening. The food- as always was excellent. Perfectly seared steaks. Creamy mashed potatoes.  Carmelized crunchy sugar crusted creme brûlée. The server was a little inattentive (maybe because we weren't big customers). And reached over me to serve my husband (who was seated to my right). Regardless, everyone loved the food.

Overall, for $42 a great deal - I'd be willing to pay much more for that! Only downside: The wine pairing didn't make any sense. What happened - there was no connection between wine and food, eg a heavy red for the desert. Still - enjoyed the evening, very classy location, and delicious food!

"Came here for restaurant week with my fiance. Made reservations, but they were running a little late so we waited about 15 minutes for our table.  This was a last minute decision to come here for dinner and was totally under dress but they did not give me any trouble. The inside of the restaurant looks fancy and dim. Great place for date if you are trying to impress. The chairs were cushiony and comfortable. For starter she had the clam chowder while I had the caesar salad.  The clam chowder was not too creamy but was delicious. Caesar salad was normal.  For entree she had the filet mignon and I had the sirloin steak.  The filet mignon was a little burnt on the outside but the inside was a perfect medium.  The sirloin was cooked perfectly too. It was a little more flavorful than the filet mignon but a little more fatty.  It was a pretty big steak.  For dessert we had the cheesecake. It was delicious. Kind of like half creme burlee and half cheesecake.  It was not overly sweet and just tasted really good. Our server Jonathan was excellent.  Everything came fairly quickly and made sure our food was ok.  Our water were continuously refilled.  Overall we had a great experience from this restaurant.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

We ended up waiting more than 45 min to be seated. They kept telling us ""Your table will be ready shortly"".. (I had to be somewhere by 9pm and needless to say I was late to the meeting.) I understand things can get crazy during restaurant week but no one apologized to us or tried to make up for keeping us wait that long. How unprofessional and inconsiderate.

Worked out perfectly since we had about an hour to eat. My 3 course meal consisted of Caesar salad, salmon, and creme brûlée. The food itself was satisfying. Service on the other hand was somewhat friendly and strange. We were first greeted and served by a female bartender, but toward the middle and end of our meal she completely tuned us out. A gentleman bartender took over and took care of our needs. The place itself is extremely beautiful the workers on the other hand seemed too pretentious. Would I return? I'd probably get a different feel at the dining room tables, but not sure if I would actually make an effort on going back.

"Reserved a table for 4 on a Wednesday night to celebrate my mothers birthday. Once we got to the table we were delighted to find the table with confetti and a hand written birthday card to my mom. Honestly that was the nicest and sweetest thing a restaurant has ever done. The act of that alone deserves 5 stars itself. For the table we had the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella as appetizer. We also decided to share the bone dry crusted sirloin, filet with lobster tail, scallops and lamb chops. We also had a size of asparagus. The scallops with mushroom risotto was my absolute favorite. Everything else was good but not too memorable. The crusted sirloin was pretty burnt. The asparagus was a little disappointing... Kinda tough. On opentable I requested that if I don't get a chance to choose a dessert, please choose one for me, anything but chocolate. They brought out 3 desserts for the 4 of us. I was so happy to see my mom so happy! I did notice they kinda just threw spoons at us though but at the end, we were there to celebrate my moms birthday and as long as she left happy, I don't care what happens.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"I'm not a big fan of chains, but I make an exception for Capital Grill. I've dined at the Chrysler Building location three times in the past. This time I dined at the West 51st St location in Manhattan with an opentable reservation. When we arrived, the white table napkins were changed to black napkins because our slacks were dark. The only other place that did that was Veranda in the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas.  The service was nearly flawless with one slip up. Our server Josue Minor was,overall, exceptional! We were given an Amuse Bouche that was delicious. Our appetizers were the Mozzarella with tomato and basil with 15 year aged balsamic that was excellent and large enough to share and the Russel Sprouts Salad with toasted pecans goat cheese and smoked bacon which was also excellent and large enough to share. I wish they indicated that on the menu since my dining partner and I were baffled at how the tuna tartare was listed as ""for 2"" but the appetizers we ordered weren't. They should be. Entrees were the Sushi grade sesame seared tuna with gingered rice and 3 sauces and the Seared Halibut with Sake braised mushrooms and miso butter. I had asked for the tuna medium rare but it arrived rare (although the center was a little warm) But... it was seared flawlessly. The skin with the sesame crust was perfect so all is forgiven. Not only that, but the tuna overall was one of the best dishes I've ever had! The Halibut was equally good. We had a side of grilled asparagus with lemon that was excellent. Because the portions are large, we shared the sorbets for dessert which were excellent as well. A wonderful meal. Why 4 instead of 5?  Two issues. They provide a bread basket and bread plates but no bread knives. I had to use the same knife that I used to cut my Mozzarella and tomato salad with balsamic to cut the butter that was presented. Second issue is that the the watier mentioned the sorbet flavors prior to our ordering them, but when he brought the sorbet he said that the flavors had actually changed from what he had told us. He should have returned to the table when he learned that the flavors were changed and informed us of the changes to see if the changes were acceptable. But, the extras more than made up for the minor slip ups.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I came here for my birthday dinner tonight and must I say I try to prepare myself too much to dress up for this place. I see people wearing shorts and sneakers. That was surprising. Anyhow, let's focus on the ambient, staffs and food. Staffs here were very welcoming and came by the table more often than you think to see how everything was going which wasn't bad. This place was all dimmed but good enough with some light where you don't have to turn your flash on to take pics. **Now for food. I came here thinking whatever I order will be small portions so why not get some appetizers along. I ordered the sliced filet mignon with caramelized onion and mushroom, to die for! It has a sweet taste which brought out the the meat flavor along with the mushroom! I had it cooked medium rare and that's the way to eat it. The middle was pink, not red so there was not blood dripping. It was the best dish I had!! I also ordered the half a dozen of oysters. The oysters were very thinly sliced and long. I must say it tastes very fresh and delicious. There were maybe one or two sand in the oysters, but that's normal. My bad ordered the 14oz ages sirloin steak and it was huge and thick. We both ordered medium rare on our meats. His however, due to the thickness, medium rare looked like it was so raw inside. I couldn't even swallow the center raw part which was disappointing, but my bad enjoyed it so its really preference. Along with his steak, he also ordered a jumbo crab cake cocktail. Do not order this. It tastes and looked like those meats you pull out of a king crab and dip it into sauce. That was it. Nothing special. Lastly we ordered the cheesecake.

Salads were excellent.   Really liked how fresh the greens were, very tasty and well dressed, not drenched.

"I came here for my birthday and they did not disappoint. They had birthday confetti sprinkled on the table and a customized birthday card. I'm sure they do this for everyone who dines there on their birthday. It still made me feel special and it was so thoughtful. A lot of these places you'll be lucky if you get a free dessert or happy birthday. So bravo for going above and beyond. The complimentary dessert and champagne was a plus. FOOD The calamari was delicious. Crisp yet tender and I absolutely love hot cherry peppers in my calamari. The crab cake was so lack luster. Under seasoned, underwhelming and uninspired. I wanted it to taste fresher and have more crab. The corn succotash that accompanied it was great. They had a special of lobster bisque that was a total fail. I honestly believe they were trying to get rid of the clam chowder they have on the regular menu. The lobster bisque did not taste like lobster nor did it have much lobster in it and the texture was weird. Total waste of $15 for that small cup. The double cut lamb chops were heavenly. Cooked a perfect medium they were tender and seasoned well. Seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail Was divine. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and lobster was cooked perfectly literally melted in my mouth. They also had a king crab special with steak. I didn't want the steak so I just asked for a side of crab. I couldn't believe they charged me $28 for that less than half portion of crab with 3 legs pieces attached. It essentially tasted like nothing. Honestly I believed the chef shocked it in some boiling water then put it on a plate to be served. I was baffled by the lack of care and flavor. For dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the chocolate hazelnut cake. I didn't expect to like the cream pie as much as I did. I thought it would be cloyingly sweet and it was surprisingly well balanced. Had a lot of different textures ranging from crunchy, creamy and chewy which was very nice. The hazelnut cake was good. It could have benefited from being left out at room temp a little before serving the ganache and mousse was a little to stiff. Good flavor though. SERVICE Everyone was superb from the hostess down to the bussers. Polite, smiling, water glasses never went empty our server was very funny and chatty but in a good way which I loved.

I was not cheated with small pieces of lobster, NO! I had full claws, there was no denying that.

It was my first time trying wine and I was clueless on which to choose. Our waitress explained the difference in certain wines, like taste and strength.

"**WINTER 2014 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW** Two friends and I had a reservation on a Friday night at 7 p.m. While the place wasn't packed, I would still make a reservation - especially if you plan to go during restaurant week. For $38, you get an appetizer, entree, side and a dessert. Here's the rundown: Appetizer - I went with the clam chowder. I'm not crazy about clam chowder but it was good - not overly creamy (which I hate) and there was a good amount of clams in there. Entree - I decided to splurge and go with the extra $10 upgrade option. This was the 18 oz. bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. I am no steak connoisseur by any means but I do know that I enjoyed every bite of it. The shallot butter was pure heroin. There is no other way to describe it. I couldn't really taste the Kona (Hawaiian coffee) but I didn't mind. At first, I thought 18 oz. might be a little too much - but let's not be silly. There's no such thing as too much steak, right? Side - I chose the French green beans but they were a tad too salty. My friend got the mashed potatoes and as soon as I took a bite, I wish I had gotten that. It was creamy perfection. Dessert - To top off the meal, I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake. This was my first flourless cake experience so I didn't know what to expect. The consistency was almost brownie/chocolate bar-like. I'm probably not explaining it very well but trust me on this one, you can skip it. it was way too chocolatey and rich for my taste. Go for the cheesecake. Wine - I think our server mentioned there were over 1000 (?) different bottles of wine. Some are pretty reasonably priced too. You can get a bottle for $30. We weren't sure which to order but we knew we wanted the prosecco. When we asked our server, she seemed pretty knowledgeable. I also appreciated the fact that she told us that the different bottles of prosecco tasted pretty much the same - and didn't try to push a more expensive bottle on us. Which brings me to my next point - service was great! Our server was always checking in on us - refilling our water glasses and more importantly, our prosecco glasses! The Capital Grill was more of a splurge for me but I would definitely come back for a special occasion. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some daydreaming to do about that shallot butter.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"This place is nothing short of excellent. Midtown is full of expensive and fancy steakhouses nowadays, and I don't think any of them are bad, but I will say that the service and care you receive here is just so above par as is the food. Highly recommended for any occasion, and the lobster mac and cheese is the best thing I've ever had in my life here!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
I celebrated my Birthday here this weekendand I must say the service and the food were amazing. Our waiter Tim was very attentive and gave the best service. They wrote me a had written note and decorated the table for my birthday. It was an amazing way to celebrate my Birthday. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and come here again.,5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Love their steaks and burgers. They recently had a special burger and wine special for $25 and it was fabulous. Best burger in nyc hands down.,4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here for a RW lunch and thought it was just alright. Service here is a little strange - friendly, but in almost an offputting way. I asked the server to recommend a couple of dishes to me and he basically read me the entire menu then cackled to himself. Then, when the burgers came out, we asked the other server which ones were medium and which one was medium rare and our original server came by and cut us off and remarked ""we go by seat number! stop asking him!"" .... Anyway, we had the soup, burger with truffle fries, and a creme brulee/chocolate cake. Soup was good albeit a little small, burger was an extremely large portion and just okay, truffle fries were good, and creme brulee was disappointing. Instead of coming out with a crisp seared top, it tasted like egg pudding with sugar crystals sprinkled on top. Glad I didn't come here for its regular menu, but even for restaurant week prices I could have enjoyed a better meal elsewhere.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here on Saturday at 7:15pm for a friend's birthday - we made a last minute reservation the day before and were seated promptly upon arrival. It didn't look too full when we got there though, so reservations might not have been required. I ordered the Gorgonzola truffle steak, medium ""plus."" I was told this would be something in between medium and medium well, but it was basically just medium well. Despite that, it was very tender, which is impressive. As for the overall dish, the cheese was unsurprisingly very strong and overpowered everything else. It was good though, especially since I like Gorgonzola. We also ordered two side dishes to share - truffle fries, and Brussels sprouts with bacon and Parmesan. They were both pretty good; I prefer thin fries and these were on the thicker side, but they were seasoned and cooked very well. The entrees plus the two sides were definitely enough food for two, and one side would probably have been plenty - we couldn't even finish the fries because we were too full!",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Pretty good restaurant - not too high end but definitely not low end.  We were looking for a restaurant that was going to have good food, business casual dress, and had a New York vibe. It was decently dim lit inside, they had interested decor but it was neat (this was my first time to a Capital Grille).  The wait staff was all very knowledgeable but laid back at the same time.  I had a mojito - definitely wasn't my favorite by far but the entree was really, really good. I had the steak and lobster.  Very tender steak, perfectly seasoned lobster, and all a pretty good portion.  We also had the mac and cheese - it was quite tasty!  We had plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day. Overall - classy restaurant, walked right in off the streets of New York around 9:00 pm and had no wait.  Not the cheapest bill but overall great food and great experience.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Spent good time at this restaurant. Worth paying the money and visiting. Grilled steak has strong taste and that meat quality is also good. Lobster is also recommended. The atmosphere and staff service is comfortable. Basically excellent! I wanna go to this table again.,4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Chain steakhouses can be hit or miss but this one does things well.  The filet mignon steak was very good.  Service was mostly good and the restaurant is nice.   I'd recommend for a corporate or family steak dinner.,4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here for a friend's birthday and also for restaurant week. Restaurant week was $38. I ordered the salad w/ bacon pieces along with the 14oz strip steak, mashed potatoes and the creme brûlée. The restaurant looks very fancy and dim. Our waiter's name was Steve and he was very very polite. Service was great and the steak was perfectly cooked the way I like it, medium rare. Would definitely come back here. Servers always checked up on our table to see if we needed anything and always refilled our water. Creme brûlée was a perfect portion as well. A++ P.S. 18oz steak isn't necessary. The 14oz was the perfect amount, wasn't stuffed or bloated.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Best service of our entire NYC trip!  Our waitress Diana was super friendly and very knowledgeable. They should clone her! We both ordered from the theater menu (great deal at $39 and the Kona sirloin was excellent) and the generous pour event. The wine served during the generous pour event was good, not great, but the variety and amount more than make this the best value I've ever seen at a fine dining establish.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Work friends like coming here for drinks. Whether you find space at the bar can be hit or miss though. Sometimes it's jam packed. Yesterday was empty. We had the lump crab which I really like there. And the shrimp cocktail which was ok. The food is not cheap but about average for seafood.,3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"My friend treated me to a birthday dinner.  I am on a self imposed tour of all the top steakhouses in NYC.  The reason for the three stars is simple; our waiter suggested we try the special of the evening which was a 160z bone-in filet mignon.  When it arrived, it had the appearance of a shriveled up dog bone. While it was flavorful, I had to share my bone-in dry crusted kona strip with shallot butter which was juicy, cooked appropriately, and was plentiful. It just seemed strange that a waiter would recommend a dish and then agree with us later about our objections to the dish.  We honestly shared our feelings with the waiter and he did remove the Parmesan  truffled French fries from the bill. We did enjoy the fresh mozzarella,basil,tomatoes with 15yo balsamic-fresh,tasty, good portions. Would we go back? Well, with a bill of $162 +tip (without the fries) and all the great competition in NYC, we are in no rush.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"It's an overall nice place to eat. We came here during restaurant week. It was a Friday night, and we had reservations for 8:30pm. Got there early, and there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated; we were seated at around 8:50pm. Still, the hosts/hostesses did a good job in maintaining the calm despite several people expressing their frustration at the tardiness - free champagne was offered to everyone waiting eventually. The service here is on point, I must highlight this immediately. Our glasses were never less than half full, and the servers were definitely on top of their game despite having a full house to cater to. When we were seated our server promptly came by and suggested the nightly specials and the restaurant favorites. We didn't have long to wait for our food (or maybe we thought so because there was plenty of bread at the table while we waited), and when they did arrive the portions were not small despite being restaurant week and the quality of the food didn't suffer because of it, either. Overall a great experience - we'll definitely be back! (afterthought: bathrooms were spacious and clean too)",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
The Capital Grille is a very upscale restaurant that test you like royalty. The ambience and decor were very golf-club old America-esque. The service was great and they did not rush us even during busy lunch when we had no reservation. The Capital Grille Burger was extremely tasteful- it tasted expensive. You must try the truffle fries as well. Dessert is also fab. The flourless chocolate cake is rich and yummy.,4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Overall, I wasn't super impressed with the quality of the food for the price. The bread crust was ultra tough (though it tasted very nice) and the lobster salad I got had overcooked lobster. Also, the dressing on the salad was overwhelmingly citrusy, to the point where I couldn't even taste the arugula. However, tasting bits of what other people got -- the filet mignon, tuna, and salmon -- it seems those were much better.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Very good steak house. We had a party of 8 people and the hostess give us a private room with huge round table. It was a big plus. My steak was perfect. $30 bottle of wine was ok.,5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"This is a really great place to celebrate any special moment. The entrance is very nice and the hostess are very friendly. I went Friday night to celebrate my husband birthday. I set up the reservation on opentable and i added on the notes that it was a bday celebration. They had a hand written card ready on the table with little balloons, it was perfect! The food was also amazing, i had the filet mignon and my husband had the tenderloins with lobster tails, sides we did the lobster mac and cheese also mashed potato. Everything was soo delicious and tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a good place to have a romantic dinner or a special moment.

"I went here for lunch with two friends for Restaurant Week.  The menu options were awesome and the food was delicious.  The portions were full size, not skimpy like some places do on a pre-fixe.  We had the wedge and ceasar salads, there was a little too much dressing on my wedge, but it was very good.  Two of us had the sirloin with an arugula salad which was odd because the appetizers were salads, so it would've been nice to have a potato or some green beans with it.  My friend had the salmon with green beans and she loved it.  For dessert the choices were a flourless chocolate torte or crème brulee - we all had the torte.  Service was good, we waited awhile between courses and the coffee came way after the dessert.  I did enjoy the ambiance it was very nice overall.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I was surprised that the food wasn't better given the price. I know this is NYC prices, but expect great food.  The Caesar salad had old lettuce which is totally unacceptable and the ahi tuna was good - but not great. The best part was the dipping sauces for the tuna. The waiter was great - but brought out the main dish before I was half way through the salad.  Overall - much better spots in NYC at the same price points.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here during my NY trip prior to attending the awesome Wicked musical. This place is walking distance to the Grimshim(?) theatre, so yay to that. Parking-- um, this is NY... so we all know how that goes. H-O-R-R-I-F-I-C. It's all about the subway system out here. Service was decent here. Nothing too spectacular compared to CA. But for NY, our waitress was EXTREMELY friendly. So props to that. My friend and I ended up getting their theatre pre fixed meal, which was the cheapest and NOT ON THE MENU. I ended up with the steak, which was eh-- I've had better. We also got the lobster mac & cheese, which was also eh as well. Nothing was really memorable or too spectacular for me. The atmosphere/environment was very dim and romantic-- which was absolutely horrible for photos unless you add 10 shots of flash. So if you're trying to instagram, don't even bother-- the lighting is way too dim. Overall, this was a decent place if you're on a strict budget (especially with good seatings at Wicked). But if you're in it for the quality-- you're better off with Ruth Chris. With that said, I doubt I'd come back because STEAK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE. Turn Ons: - Great service. Turn Offs: - Food was mediocre.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

Beautiful setting with white table cloth and candles. My filet was one of the best I have ever had, and my wife and daughter split the salmon which was also excellent.

"I had the most amazing experience at Capital Grille last night. Last minute aka 6pm, my boyfriend and I decided to try to make a 7:30 reservation for dinner. We were able to make a reservation with no problem. We arrived and were promptly seated. Our waiter asked us if we were celebrating anything and we told him that we were celebrating my boyfriend's new job. We ordered a bottle of wine and a filet mignon each with mashed potatoes and the lobster mac and cheese to share. We did not order an appetizer, but our waiter brought us Caesar salads anyways, which were delicious. Our entrées came and the steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were soo delicious. When we were finished (aka to stuffed to eat anymore because we left with doggy bags), our waiter brought us the dessert menu. We told him we were too full for dessert. He came back and surprised us with a dish that said Congratulations in CHOCOLATE with a small flour less chocolate cake and cheese cake topped with fresh berries.

"My sister and I took my mother and her best friend here for dinner Saturday night before going to a show.  We did the Theatre menu, which has options (except maybe vegetarian) for everyone.  (For those of us who try to avoid gluten, I found all the options excellent.) We loved the entire experience.  This is a great example of classic, old-fashioned steakhouse decor - dark wood, comfortable booths, etc.  The food was excellent, and the service, from the staff at the front to the waiters/busboys/maitre'd were all welcoming, professional and pleasant far beyond our expectations.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  We're pretty low-key, but they treated us like royalty. By the way, they've ruined me for anyone else's Creme Brulee.  That alone was worth it!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I had dinner here last night with two of my girlfriends for NYC Restaurant Week, my first time at this location but I have eaten at Capital Grille prior to this evening. The service was impeccable, our waiter Edgar always made sure we were well-taken care of by checking on us every so often. Only one hiccup was that they forgot to bring out our Fried Calamari appetizer until I asked about it when the entrees were being brought out. So Edgar apologized and comped it out of our bill, as well as gave us a voucher for a free Calamari appetizer during our next visit at any Capital Grille. We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and were overall pleased with the selection. For appetizers we all had the caesar salad, which was a little overdressed and not as impressive as the waiters talked it up to be. For the entree, I had the 14 oz. Bone-In NY Strip cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We had a bottle of Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon to keep us warm and rosy. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were so buttery with some potato skins mixed in. Classic creme brulee to top the meal off - it was a great experience altogether and our server for the evening played a huge role.

The service is top notch; the waiters and waitresses always make the customer their top priority and are very friendly. The food was great, on this occasion we only ordered drinks and appetizers. Since I am allergic to seafood, I had the truffle fries, the steak sliders and the lamp chop lollipops- the food was amazing. Definitely on the pricey side, but if you're worried about costs, you should rethink visiting this establishment.

"Was here for a company event and was gravely disappointed in the steak.  I ordered the porterhouse and on the menu it was described as ""dry aged"".  I was expecting an amazing cut of meet only to be disappointed.  The steak has absolutely NO dry age flavor whatsoever and tasted like a choice cut of beef.  I ordered medium rare and it came out as medium.  My colleague orders the NY Strip and his tasted just as bad.  I've had dry aged steaks before and this is definitely not what you are getting especially at such a ridiculous price",1.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I've generally had impeccable service at the restaurant chain. The steaks are one of the best, and darkm clubby atmosphere harkens back to old Hollywood movies, where business deals are made in a smoky backroom. I've visited this location before, and much prefer the one located in Fidi. Given the past experience, I was disappointed. I felt that they didn't put their best foot forward for the level service that an establishment of this caliber is capable of. Despite requesting a booth, I was seated near the frigid entrance (when wind-chill made it below freezing), and when we asked to be relocated, we were told to wait in the lobby or take one of the tables. This despite seeing numerous booths being available. We waited about 15-20 minutes to be relocated. The food (porterhouse steak, chillean seabass), as always was of high quality, but for an establishment of this range (about $300 for 2), that's a given. Part of the allure of coming here in the past was that I'm usually overwhelmed by the level of attention they give to make sure you're a happy camper. I was underwhelmed by the experience, and probably won't be returning to this location.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Came here for my husband's birthday. We both had the ribeye and it was melt in your mouth delicious. We started with fried calamari which had bits of jalapeno in it, it was ok but I'm not really a fan of fried calamari in general. This place is fancy, right by the Chrysler building and it has a partial glass ceiling. We felt real swanky having cocktails with our steak, I had the martini which was strong and tasted like poison, which is what a martini should taste like, lol, I just suck on the extra olives. He had a rum drink, which he enjoyed. Try the lobster mac and cheese, it is out this world good. The service is great, very attentive waiters and if you tell them in advance they will make sure your table is decked out with confetti and a card congratulating you on your event, whether it be birthday or anniversary and give you a complimentary dessert afterwards. I have heard of friends who say if their steak is even a bit overcooked, they will comp you on your entree.

"We had a decent meal but I have to give this restaurant a ""1""  based on service.  We left a small shopping bag underneath our booth when we left last night.  I realized it today and called the restaurant.  First the receptionist insisted there was no possibility it could still be there and flatly refused to check the booth.  Then the manager got on the phone and also refused to check the booth. ""It's impossible"" he claimed.  I asked him to check our reservation to see where we sat but he refused. ""Our cleaners would have found any bags left"". Well if you have been in the dark restaurant and looked under the booth with lots of nooks and crannies, it certainly would be possible for a small bag to be left under the seating area. Also if it was found by the cleaning crew last night, what kind of top restaurant has dishonest cleaners who wouldn't turn over a shopping bag. In either case it's just despicable. While the shopping bag certainly might not be there, it is beyond bad service to refuse to check the booth or with their cleaners.  We spent $500 on a dinner for four and it will be the last time I ever eat at any of the Capital Grilles. There are too many other fine steak houses, including Ruth's Chris right next door and Mastro's a block away to settle for either bad service or dishonesty.",1.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

Crab cakes and calamari has some kick to them, which I appreciated. The chilean sea bass in mushroom broth was, as often is the case, under-seasoned for my taste.

"A steakhouse chain well known in other parts. The restaurant itself has a nice piece of real estate near Times Square and midtown for the worker bees during the day. I went on a holiday day but it was not at all busy and now I know why. First the drink menu is on an iPad because they went paperless, the problem with that is that if I cannot make up my mind in a few Seconds I'm forced to star at an iPad held by another person for however long this indecision occurs. That's no fun. They do have a decent Malbec that goes well will steak. I chose the usual filet. It came out perfectly medium rare but it was otherwise not that interesting just a piece of meat for my mouth... The Parmesan truffle fries are really good. The mashed potatoes are basically creamed whole potatoes which also are very good. Tastes like a destroyed fresh potato in my mouth. They bring you out a random selection of 'bread' but half of it is a large non salted cracker. However the bread itself is warm which is a nice touch. Still who needs the cracker? Overall as far as fine dining experiences it's not bad. Just don't come here if you're expecting an amazing steak. It's a-ok!",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

Amazing steak. We ordered fillet and it was delicious. Ceaser salad beyond good with Perfect amount of dressing and cheese.  Mashed potatoes were soooo good.

"You should walk a few doors down to Ruth's Chris instead! Came for restaurant week dinner on a Tuesday with a friend. Wine: $29 dark horse bottle Cabernet - great for the price! Best thing about this restaurant. You get 1 star for that. Starter: Caesar salad Blue cheese wedge salad with bacon I had the wedge and thought too much dressing and I love bacon but the size of the pieces was conflicting with the salad I believe. Entree: Bone-in strip (14oz) Filet mignon (10oz) Both dishes came out looking like sad, airplane food. Both looked dry visually. I had the filet and it was DRY and I got it medium. It was so depressing that I didn't bother trying my friend's steak but he also said it wasn't so good. We both agreed these steaks were at the bottom of our list. Dessert: Both got the creme brûlée and I personally like more of the custard and a thin layer of the caramelized sugar but it tasted more like 1/2 and 1/2 so it was too intense for me. My friend, however, destroyed his and my leftover so this is subjective. Service: I won't put our server on blast but I do know his name well. We both felt kind of forgotten and service was slow and it's a Tuesday night! It didn't seem to be crazy busy so no excuse. He's a very friendly guy when you do catch him but overall, not attentive. Ambiance: Nice setting, feels very warm and cozy. I guess that is a plus, I'll add another star for that (from my initial 1!) I know this has a 4 star average from 500+ people so I'm not sure if they slack during restaurant week but overall, I won't be returning.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"I came here for restaurant week with my friends and it was pretty good. We got a nice table separated a bit from the rest which was great. They gave us the regular menu as well which was freakin' huge. The clam chowder was great and the 10 oz sirloin was cooked perfectly. The cheesecake had a caramelized coating which was delicious. They gave us enough sides for all of us instead of individually asking us what we wanted. Sam's mashed potatoes was delish and the French green beans were crunchy and fresh. My friend got the salmon and she said she's had better. My other friend got the filet mignon and he said it was nice and tender, though it looked a little charred on the outside. The chocolate espresso cake was very rich and thick which could be a little overwhelming. Other than that, service was great and the food was great overall!",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"MEAT. Mother and sister came to visit in New York, so we made reservations for 5:30 because we had A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder at 8 a few blocks down. Atmosphere: Dim. Very, very dim. Fancy and spacious. Oh, and DIM. Food: I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter. Holy mother of baby J, this was the best steak I've had in my life, to date. I asked for it medium rare and it was cooked so perfectly I could kiss the chef (probably not, but maybe a hug will suffice). The flavoring was both sweet and savory, and the meat was tender. Also, the portion was humongo. A hefty $49, but well worth it if you are willing to treat yo self. My mother got the original filet mignon dish and loved it. My sister ordered the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms, but she complained that over time, the onions and wild mushrooms made the dish way too sweet. We also shared the spinach and oscar-styled roasted potatoes. Both sides were generously portioned and accompanied our dishes very, very well. Oh, and a shout out to their bread selection here. Breadsticks, french bread, multigrain. Y'all have the key to my heart, carbs. We were too full to try dessert, so maybe next time. Service: Fantastic. Friendly, prompt, and not too overbearing.

"Finally got to try this place after the raves I got from my friends and this place did not disappoint.  Personally this place is one of the best steak houses I have ever been to.  We ordered the following items: Delmonico Steak - This was just delicious, beautifully done and with so much flavor. My friend got the sliced filet mignon which i didnt get to try, but my friend said it was delicious. For sides, we ordered the Sams Mashed Potatoes and the Asparagus which werent anything special, just fillers to help with all that meat. We topped it off with two Horse Heaven Hills glasses of red wine which I also enjoyed. Overall a great spot, when you are up for spending the high price tag for it.  The ambiance was pleasant and would definitely return on another special occassion.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Everything you would expect from an old-fashioned steak house: male servers, white serving jackets, high ceilings, clean white linen table cloths, dim lighting and of course dry aged steak. My friend and i came here for restaurant week dinner and ordered both on and off that menu. Their wedge salad is always a good way to start. That with some calamari and you've got yourself a party in your mouth! Of course their steaks are prepared just as desired - I just wish that out server placed my medium rare steak in front of me instead of my friend. And you can't go wrong with their asparagus and mashed potatoes! Finally some cheese cake and creme brûlée to end the night...and a good way to end the night at that! Don't expect your bill to be on the cheaper side- you might be able to do that if you only stick to the restaurant week menu, but not if you get a bottle of wine and order off too. Still our server was great and the bathrooms were clean.

"We came here to celebrate our anniversary and I must say I don't regret it at all! The food here is amazing and the service is just impeccable. It has the perfect romantic ambience for date night and intimate get-togethers. This was the first Capital Grille I have been to, and it is pretty good for a franchise. They have an interesting way of showing the wine and beer selection. On a tablet. There was a long list of wines and each even gave a brief description. But this definitely made it the selection process longer and a little irritating. We decided to skip appetizer and went straight to our entrees with truffle fries on the side.  Their ribeye is amazingly seasoned; medium rare was perfectly cooked. Scallops with the summer corn risotto was also amazingly well done.  We ended our dinner with their flourless chocolate cake, which was AH-mazing!

"We came for dinner one night to celebrate a special occasion. While there are many, many, many steak houses in NYC we always love The Capital Grille. No surprises about the décor, it is top notch as always. And the wait staff was attentive and quite speedy as usual. The food is what we always come back for because it is, and was, delicious. We had the pre-theater prix fixe which it such an amazing deal! (It is on their website, check it out!) The filets were perfectly cooked, the salads had the perfect amount of dressing, the sides were good (not great...) and the dessert was delicious. There is just something holding me back from giving 5stars... I honestly do not know what it is but there was just a lacking of ""wow"" factor this night. Maybe it was the fact that we had to wait 20mins, even with a reservation, but that wasn't a huge deal really (somewhat comical, in fact, because the hostess informed us that we could ""get a drink in the bar"" while we waited. As if they were complimentary - which they definitely are not!).

"For being a $$$$ restaurant with great reviews, I was unimpressed to say the least.  Maybe it's because it's Restaurant Week and I opted for the RW lunch? $25 for a cup of clam chowder, sirloin, and a dessert.  Sounds good, right?  Not really. Clam chowder - this might be the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1.  It came out hot and delicious.  Could have used more clams, but I'm not complaining.  After the clam chowder, I'm thinking this is going to be a good meal! Sirloin + salad - I asked for medium rare, which the waiter repeated back ""warm red throughout"".... welllll it was not.  Barely any blood!  My coworker got a medium which was ""pink"" throughout and that's definitely how mine came out.  He offered to take it back, but I declined.  The meat was tender but maybe I just wasn't in a red meat mood because it wasn't hitting the spot at all.  Could have been a little more grilled and seasoned.  As for the salad, I couldn't handle it because it's literally the same salad I make at home and eat on days I want to be healthy.  I wasn't here to be healthy.  It was arugula, spinach, mozz, and peppers tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette.  MEH. Chocolate espresso cake - WAY too rich - tasted like coffee flavored fudge and had the consistency of thick pudding.  Blah.

"Oh Capital Grille...I had such high hopes for you! I've been wanting to eat at your restaurant, ever since you took over space in the monstrosity known as the Beverly Center and you made it so pretty. But I suppose that the Beverly Center is another whole review... In any case, I'm living in NYC now, and visited the midtown location. And here are my thoughts: Ambiance: Capital Grille is beautiful...love the steakhouse-vibe it has (as it should). Everything, including the restrooms, are spotless. I can't fault CG in this area. Service: The waiter was super nice but he kept disappearing. We had to ask another waiter to find him, just so we could place our order. Strange. Food: The only good thing about our meal? The phenomenal bread basket. I mean, this was an AMAZING bread basket, and I have very high standards when it comes to bread. For $43 I had the pleasure of not enjoying my entree of sea bass (I think?) in a mushroom sauce. The sauce tasted exactly like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom. I don't like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom. So no need to elaborate I suppose? My husband was not impressed with his steak either. ""Ruth's Chris is the best,"" is all he kept repeating. It was annoying but I let him vent. After suggesting CG, I figured it was the least I could do. My daughter ordered the children's burger with fries. I am not a fan of children's menus, even less a fan of hamburger's on a children's menu, but I let her have her way for once. She obviously regretted that, saying ""This burger tastes funny."" Hmm. I bit back a ""Maybe you should listen to our mom next time?"" Our sides of steamed broccoli and asparagus were fine, nothing to write home about. The Bottom Line: If I'm being honest, I can get a better piece of fish from Fairway's deli. For less than 1/4 of what I paid at CG. I don't see the point in returning to Capital Grille and neither does the rest of my family.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"I came here for a nice dinner with the wife during Restaurant Week. Really enjoyed the restaurant. It had a nice, classy atmosphere. The servers were super friendly and professional. We ordered the Lollipop Lamb Chops from the bar menu. It was perfectly cooked and tasted delicous. It might have been the best lamb chops I ever had! I had the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin steak for the main entree. It was pretty good, but I guess I was expecting a little better given that Capital Grille is known for their steak. The entrees did come with free sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. I couldn't have enough of the creamed spinach! It had the perfect combination of spinach and cream! For desert I had the Creme Brulee, which wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The custard base was just not thick enough. It might have been the worst creme brulee I ever had! This is a nice restaurant to take a date. It also has a corporate atmosphere at the same time, so it's nice for a work dinner also. So overall, as you can see, I had both positive and negative experience with the food at Capital Grille. I'll still give it a 4 star given that the atmosphere and service was excellent.

Creme brûlée was classic, with a thin sugar crunch and tons of yummy fruit on top. It was creamy and custardy without being too eggy. Ambiance is nice but not required dressy- we actually ended up swinging by last minute for creme brûlée only, dressed in tennis shoes and shorts, but the menu looked so good we ate full on meals!

As the hubster's niece said, ""This place is like a scene out of 'Mad Men.'"" And yes, it's a classic chophouse that serves suits but they know how to cater to families/tourists who are visiting the Big Apple looking for the Big Apple experience. Steaks done perfectly medium rare and lobster all buttery and melty in your mouth. Even the breads are good! I also had the tuna tartare the second night as (believe it or not) I was meated out. The rice that came with the tuna, however, was mushy. Yes, I know you're not an Asian joint, but everyone should know how to cook rice! All the soups were luscious and tasty: the French Onion, the lobster bisque, and the clam chowda were all robust and could've been a meal on their own. And you have to get their cheesecake. It is AMAZE-BALLS! I even love the crust and I'm usually not a crust-girl at all; I only eat the insides of pies for example. Seriously, I'd come back just for that cheesecake which was a hit with our table of 8.

When I told the server that we are going to order from the RW menu, he looked disappointed. Continuously asking if we are done if each plate while I was still eating from it.. was annoying. Good service (with good food) makes customers return. At one point, we had our desserts flung to our table with no utensils for like 5 mins... uhhh what. The food- The clam chowder was good.

Basic tasty brulee. Date ordered the chicken, was pretty good too. Thought it would be dry since it was a large breast, but was juicy and flavorful.

"We came here for restaurant week, and seemed to have been judged for it by the waitress (shoulder-level hair, brunette; black thick-rimmed glasses). She was very cold with us and seemed to try to get us out of the restaurant as soon as we arrived. Beware, you will be judged here. The food was decently good. The creme brulee had a sub-par finish, but the flourless chocolate cake was delicious.

"WHOAAAAAAAA Didn't expect to have such a good time here.  We settled on The Capital Grille for Restaurant Week because we found out Salt & Fat was closed due to being on vacation (sadface) so this was our next option. Place is sleek, dark, classy, and romantic.  It's huge, and I loved how the kitchen wall had clocks in different time zones for Chicago, Tokyo, London, etc along with old-fashioned paintings and a huge glass paneled room filled with racks and racks of wine.  Very classy. Our waitress Adrienne had such an amazing personality.  She really cared about us, and knew her stuff from top to bottom.  Since we were going to go drink later, we ordered Diet Cokes with multiple refills, but she only charged us for one drink each.  When we drained our glasses, we were talking about getting another refill when she just appeared out of thin air, tray full of Diet Cokes and replacing ours.  Water glasses never ran empty, and we were always made sure we were checked on upon. I ordered the bone-in aged Kona steak, and my friend ordered the 8 oz filet mignon.  We ended up switching dishes because we liked each other's more.  Filet mignon cut through like butter and I didn't even need A1 sauce (go ahead, tell me that I'm tacky) to eat it. We also ordered the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and lobster mac & cheese.  Like everyone else, the lobster mac & cheese was the show stealer.  They breaded their macaroni so that it was crispy on the outside and soft and cheesy when you bit into it.  It was so rich, I had to doggy bag it home (which they do for you in this adorable paper bag wrapping) Creme brulee - so good.  It comes with an assortment of strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries on top.  I finished the whole thing, and I rarely ever finish desserts because I'm so full by the end.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"My first Yelp review and my first time at Capital Grille! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I started with a Ceasar Salad and had the Salmon as my entree, it was delightful, as were the mashed potatoes. I opted to finish off my meal with a nice cheesecake. My server name was Josue, he did an excellent job of checking on the table for anything we might have needed.

"Came here on Friday night for Restaurant Week and ordered the caesar salad, 8 oz filet mignon with the jumbo shrimp upgrade option ($10 extra), mashed potatoes, and cheesecake for dessert. The ""caesar salad"" that came out was actually a garden salad. Me and my friend realized this mix-up when actual caesar salads were brought out to the table next to us. Not cool. Filet mignon was juicy and tender, but the sauce(?) was a little sweet for my liking. My upgrade option came with 3 grilled jumbo shrimps, and they were cooked to perfection! Very nice addition to my meal. My other friend ordered a medium rare kona crusted sirloin and it was VERY good, but on the chewy side. The sauce on her steak was delicious. Mashed potatoes were very good - creamy and soft. The cheesecake was good, but the top of the cake had a burnt taste to it. It wasn't exactly bad, but I could have done without it. Their wine menu is VERY extensive -- I think our waitress mentioned over a thousand options. We ordered a $30 bottle of prosecco and we really enjoyed it! Service was amazing. Our waitress checked up on us often, and was really friendly the whole time. I didn't get a single bad vibe from her, or anyone working there for that matter. Good steak! Definitely come here for restaurant week - you will not be disappointed. I think the regular pricing for their steaks are around $45, so it's definitely affordable even if you don't visit for restaurant week!",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Great job was done by the restaurant in both celebrating a birthday with grace and delicious style, and accommodating me as a vegan...in a steakhouse!  Not wanting to drag down the fun of my meat eating friends and family can make going out to dinner frustrating and often results in a green side salad and baked potato, but not this time! Service from Alyssa was impeccable and she really helped to make our experience. all of the meat eaters loved their steaks, and my vegan options were either a grilled tofu steak over veggies or a pasta with veggies - I gave into the carb attack and had the pasta which was very pleasant.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Awesome! With its dark wood paneling and large portraits on the walls, this place has the old school upscale vibe/charm to it. A friend and I had dinner here recently during restaurant week. The service was very professional, efficient & friendly without being over bearing. They have a fairly extensive wine list with several very reasonably priced bottles within the $50 range. We started with the ceasar salad & the field greens, followed by the 8oz Filet & Parmesan and Herb marinated Tournedos for main course. Both were cooked to perfection. Got mashed potatoes & fresh Creamed spinach for sides. For dessert we had the Classic Creme Brulee & Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. Both - divine.

"There were a group of us (5) that stopped by here for dinner last friday. Decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice vibe to it. We waited for about 20 mins for our table, and then were taken to the quiet room off the bar at the front of the restaurant.  This space seemed a little out of the way, and didn't have the same vibe as the rest of the space. Our waitress was nice and friendly, however she probably had too many tables, and was difficult to find when we needed anything. Once we ordered our food, it took some time before we received our appetizers.  We ordered the mozzarella and tomatoes, along with the calamari. Calamari was decent, however, you could only eat a small portion due to the saltiness of the hot peppers.  The mozzarella (caprese salad) was terrible... enough that after 1 bite, we returned it. For the main course, we all ordered individual items, and some sides. I had the tuna steak, and it was a nice piece of fish, however didn't have much flavor at all. The ginger rice was decent. The best items were the sides.. we had the mashed potatoes (amazing), along with the spinach (really good), and the mushrooms (really good). We decided not to order desert, as it was taking too long. Overall, not a great dining experience.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
After seeing a delightful NYC Rockettes show at Radio City we stumbled upon this Cap Grill on a warm 2013 December night. We had a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. Fantastic ppl watching. Great host and hostess who seated us within twenty minutes of what was going to be an hour long wait. I loved our table. We were seated around families but the noise level was fine. We had Calamari for an app. He had the French Onion soup while I had a house salad. He settled on a Ribeye and I did a filet Oscar style. I wanted it well done which my friend strongly objected to! The waiter happily obliged. My steak was great. We shared a Creme Brûlée for dessert.  The staff was courteous. It was a wonderful night .,3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"This place is beautiful, service was great and the food was so delicious!  Love the painting of historical famous people around the restaurant. I went to this place for restaurant week during the winter with my friend.  Waiter greeted us and introduced himself.  Asked us what we would to drink and offered us the wine list on an iPod.  We didn't order any wine.  We just drink water.  We were hungry for steak lol.  They start you off with a basket of bread (varies type) with a small plate of butter.  The bread was fresh.  Loved the garlic bread and the one with fruit in it.  The waiter even scraped the crumbs off the table before the appetizers arrive. Appetizer -  my friend and I both ordered a Caesar side salad.  Cannot go wrong with a salad.  It was good. Entree -My friend ordered 8oz fillet mignon and I ordered Bone-in dry aged sirloin steak 14oz.  Both medium well.  Side dishes were mashed potatoes and french string beans with heirloom tomatoes.  My steak was amazing!  Cooked the way I wanted.  It was perfection.  Well seasoned.  The same with my friend fillet mignon.  The sides was really good especially the mashed potatoes.  Buttery and seasoned with herbs.  Also it had bits of the potato skin in the mash. Dessert- we ordered flourless chocolate cake and ClassiC Crème Brûlée.  Both are very good! Our waiter was very nice and provided great service.  We told the waiter to send our complement to the chef.  We received a complimentary card for calamari to use on our next visit.  Would definitely come back here again.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

I ordered the clam chowder to start off with, and it's probably some of the best chowder I ever had! For my entrée,  I ordered the chicken and was kind of perturbed by the dry taste it had. I also wish the meal had more side dishes, because the only other food it came with was carrots, which were also a little hard to bite into. For dessert,  I had a delicious chocolate espresso cake, although kind of dry. Overall, I'd give this place a 3, but.......this place had some of the best clam chowder I've ever had and had a cake, that tasted like a mocha espresso from Starbucks.  I'm gonna be generous, and give this place a 4 out of 5.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"My parents were in town for the weekend and as per tradition, I took them to a steakhouse. I had recently taken my sister to the location in midtown east for her birthday and we had a phenomenal time; I decided to give this location a try because my parents were staying closer to this location. I will preface this with the fact that this was restaurant week. When we first arrived, the restaurant was packed. There were probably about 6 or more groups waiting for a table in the main entry way. I actually ran into someone using the revolving door because people were so jammed in there. I arrived 15 minutes early for my reservation and tried to check in. They could not find my reservation under my name, so the hostess politely called the other location. I checked in again and we found my reservation (under a different last name). We were seated about 20 minutes late, but didn't mind as we were enjoying wine at the bar. (the hostess was awesome! Friday evening 2/21) We were shown to a table by a very unfriendly gentleman. I had seen a couple other parties sat and the people who showed them their tables (they have about 3 people doing this) were very friendly and polite and explained the menu options. Ours however clearly had an issue with seating us the 50 feet from the hostess stand. This began the rude encounter of dinner. Our waitress approached the table, but did not introduce herself. I believe her name was Tracie, but could be mistaken as I was too scared to look her in the eye. She took about 5 minutes to fill our water glasses and then another 10 before she bothered to check back for a drink order. She was rude from the very moment she took our wine order. As people have mentioned- the bread basket here is amazing. So delicious. We opted to order from the pre-fixe menu because it is a pretty good deal. As we were placing our order, the waitress continued her snobby attitude. When attempting to order the caesar salad with no dressing, the waitress looked at me and said ""you do realize thats just a plate of romaine lettuce?"" Having ordered this before, I know that this in fact includes cheese and croutons as well. She proceeded to have a 30 second argument about this. After taking my order, she continued to my mother. Now I realize to give five minutes to a table is precious time in the serving industry (I have a serving job as well), but I have NEVER cut anyone off. As my mother was deciding her dessert the waitress was apparently too busy to wait the 30 seconds and cut my mother off and continued to my father. When the salads came, they placed all the wrong orders in front of the wrong patron. I am pretty sure that you use seat numbers at this restaurant to avoid this type of issue. When we all swapped salads, we finally dug in. They were OK. The mixed green salad seemed as though it came from a bagged mix and the dressing was watered down. Again, when the entree's showed up, they were delivered to the wrong patron. While I realize this is nit-picking, it is still supposed to be a ""high end"" steakhouse. The entree's were subpar. The cook on the steaks were all correct, but they lacked seasoning. Our waitress barely asked how our food was, let alone offered any fresh pepper as I saw all the other waiters offering their tables. This would have helped with the flavor inconsistency. Dessert was the highlight of the evening, but I highly doubt they have their own pastry chef in house. If they do- Delicious and amazing! All in all it was a pretty disappointing experience. My parents never complain about service and enjoy dining in NYC because they are not from here. However, even my parents thought it was pretty bad. As a server, I always leave 20% even if the service isn't my favorite because this is someones income. However, we did NOT leave 20% at this table. I am sure the waitress rolled her eyes and was not happy, however, the tip reflects the service. I wish I could have left less and not have felt guilty about it. She was rude and inattentive. Do yourselves a favor. Hop the subway to grand central and eat at the location in midtown east- it is a much better overall experience.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Dined here last Friday, pre-theatre, with my girlfriend and one of our friends. Being that we we seeing a show, we all ordered off the pre-theatre menu, which is a great deal for $39. It's pretty much equivalent to a Restaurant Week meal. You're given three or four choices per course and for our appetizers, we ended up ordering the Ceasar Salad and Clam Chowder. For our entrees, we had one filet, one Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter and one Double Cut set of three Lamb Rip Chops. Appetizers were very yummy all around. The clam chowder was hearty, but not overly thick and had a good amount of clams. The Ceasar Salad with fresh and well dressed. Moving on to the mains, I ordered my lamb chops medium rare and they arrived perfectly cooked, very juicy and very tasty. They did come resting on oil and vinegar, which I just brushed off. As for the filet, just note that on their online menu, it lists a 10 oz filet, but once you're in the restaurant, the menu lists an 8 oz filet. Anyways, the filet, also ordered medium rare, came perfectly cooked, but was otherwise underseasoned and somewhat bland. The same goes for the sirloin - perfectly cooked at medium rare, but maybe it was the Kona crusting? Something was off - it lacked the good and sizzling charred taste of a sirloin. In terms of the sides - mashed potates and creamed spinach, we had two orders of potatoes and one of spinach. Both were excellent. You could really taste the butter and the milk in the potatoes too. We all opted for the sorbet for dessert and chose mango and lemon as our flavors. For whatever reason, we were all served two scoops of mango and one of lemon. Both were yummy, but it would've been nice to have more lemon. Service was overall very friendly and professional, but after we arrived back home, there was a major gaffe. In addition to taking our leftover meat home, we'd also asked for the remained of the potatoes and spinach (there was a lot of each), as well as the remainder of the bread, since there was a lot and it'd otherwise just get thrown away. Upon looking at our food the next day, no bread was included and we barely got any potatoes or spinach. Sigh... almost makes the $39 per person for the theatre menu not worth it. In the end, disappointing.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Great choice for restaurant week.  Of the many menus I scoped out, theirs was definitely one of the most substantial and best bang for your buck. For the $38 dinner option you get a choice of appetizer (garden salad, caesar salad or NE clam chowder), entree (3 steak choices - 8 oz filet, two 4 oz medallions, 14 oz seared sirloin or a fish/salmon), choice of side (mashed potatoes or creamed spinach) and dessert (creme brulee, flourless chocolate espresso cake, ice cream vanilla/choc/strawberry or sorbet mango/peach/lemon).  It sounds like a lot of food, and believe me, it is. But is the food good you ask?  Well the clam chowder was decent.  Not very thick but had a good flavor.  My friend's caesar salad looked pretty good and the size was pretty big.  The steaks were solid.  The filet had a great flavor and was very tender.  The sirloin was also very good.  It wasn't as amazing as a Peter Luger steak, but it was still pretty decent and the meat was surprisingly tender for a sirloin cut.  The sauce/gravy that they used was also quite tasty. The sides were pretty huge.  I ordered the mashed and my buddy ordered the spinach and it was more than enough to share for 2 people.  The potatoes were quite tasty, though the spinach was a bit too creamy for my taste. The desserts were okay.  The sorbets felt surprisingly heavy and were a bit too sweet.  The chocolate espresso cake was also pretty heavy. Net net, this menu is a pretty darn good deal for restaurant week.  If you're in the mood for steak, this is definitely a place worth considering.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Wow, where should I start with this review.  Okay I suppose I'll start from the beginning of the evening. Me and my two friends were staying at the W Times Square Hotel on 47th and Broadway.  While searching for a place to dine we popped open the Yelp app on my iPad and found the Capital Grille, located at 120 W. 51st St., in the hundred or so restaurants located within four or five square blocks of the hotel.  It seemed to get pretty positive reviews with average of 4 out of 5 stars given by Yelp user reviewers, and also seemed to receive a decent number of reviews, with 400+ total reviews posted, if I remember correctly.  I typically use the total number of reviews metric as an indicator of whether a restaurant is popular enough that people are impelled to go back online to leave reviews after dining there. When we arrived we chose to sit in the bar area so we could watch the Panthers at Seahawks playoff game.  The place was not very busy most likely due to the bone chilling 18° temperature outside in New York City.  I believe this worked in our favor for the evening because we ended up with extremely attentive service and super fast food delivery times.  So upon entering, we grabbed a cocktail table and were greeted within a minute or two by the bartender Jeremy. Throughout the entire evening Jeremy constantly checked on us to make sure our water glasses were never empty and made top notch drinks - the perfect combination of alcohol and accouterment.  I prefer strong drinks and these drinks had plenty of kick and were a joy to consume.  Quite tasty indeed! We ordered several rounds of appetizers.  The two appetizer dishes we enjoyed most were the lobster macaroni and cheese, and lobster and crab cakes.  We actually stumbled upon the lobster mac and cheese and Jeremy mentioned it was a great choice, as that appetizer is one of the most popular dishes on the menu.  It was absolutely incredible. We also tried the 10 ounce filet mignon entrée, and ordered some sides of creamed spinach, and asparagus, along with the wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon and lollipop lamb chops.  The food was literally on our table within five minutes of ordering.  Oh I forgot to mention that the chef actually sent out complimentary sautéed wild mushrooms (which were very juicy and flavorful) and Sam's mashed potatoes for us to nibble as a courtesy for dining there that evening.  It was quite clear that the Capital Grille staff was genuinely happy to have us in their establishment and wanted us to thoroughly enjoy the experience. After finishing our food, we proceeded to order our last round of drinks, and Jeremy brought three glasses of the pineapple-infused vodka (Stoli Doli) sitting behind the bar as well!  The perfect digestif to an outstanding dining experience. The last thing on which I would like to comment was the atmosphere and décor of the restaurant.  The ambience was warm and soft with a subtle yet energetic feeling permeating throughout the dining room and bar.  The quality and finish of the furniture and interior décor was clearly a result of top notch workmanship and materials.  Simply a beautiful restaurant - well decorated and properly lit to create the perfect dining atmosphere. After our superb experience this past weekend, my friends and I have agreed to make this a must visit on any future trips to Manhattan.  I strongly recommend you spend a few hours to visit this place one evening while in the City.  You won't be disappointed!",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Stopped by the Capital Grille for dinner last night on a whim. We couldn't have been more pleased with the food quality, service and atmosphere. We made a reservation last minute which was graciously accepted even though the place was packed. On top of it, we were given a gigantic booth which was comfortable and spacious. I don't know what it is about a big booth, but damned if it's not the best place to sit in any restaurant from McDonald's on up. The waiter was a gem; quick and attentive without being a nuisance (as the waiters in Del Frisco's have become). As for the atmosphere, it was lively without being uncomfortably loud as it can be in some steakhouses. I went with the 10 oz. filet mignon, medium rare, my girl got the rack of lamb. We also split the mashed potatoes. Everything was outstanding. My steak was top quality, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My one minor complaint was that they plated the steak on a savory reduction which I thought was unnecessary considering how juicy the meat was. The lamb was very tasty, and the side was velvety smooth and delicious, primarily in part to a gaudy, though delicious, use of butter. I finished up the evening with a Courvoisier VSOP, and my girl opted for the 1100 calorie coconut cream pie, bless her. In the end, it was a great experience all around. It wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was quite close. Highly recommended.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"I want to give this place 7 stars for service, because our server was the most amazing woman ever. This is mom's favorite place, so we went here for Restaurant Week.  We were very early (which is odd for both of us) and they seated us right away.  Our server was prompt and was honest about the wines and the food.  I think she could tell that my mom and I were no BS kind of girls - you know the Queens and Brooklyn type. The wine took forever to come, but I think that has something to do with their semolier or wine expert.  I believe they take the order then slowly open that bottle of wine to let it breathe.  They probably don't let the server take the wine until it's really ready. My mom had tasty steak and clam chowder, I had really good salmon and a caesar salad.  I asked for my salmon rare, it came out more well - yet it was sooo good I actually did not send it back (event though the server insisted).  The server brought us berries and creme anglais with our dessert just because I was super cool about my salmon.  I felt both of my dishes were good, but not 5 star worthy. Chocolate cake - oh yes, this was worth talking about.  And I would say some more about it, but my mouth is salivating over my keyboard and it's getting harder to type.

The salad was dressed well and the clam chowder was good.  I should also mention that the bread basket has a few nice selections.  The steaks came out and they were rare instead of medium rare and they had no favor.  The texture of the meat was weird as well.  The desserts....I can't even remember them. Bottom line, not sure if it's because it was RW but this place was terrible.  Probably one of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.  I would never come here, especially for it's regular menu as it has the same price point as the top tier steakhouses.

The ceasar salad was fresh & well dressed The steak (I had the herb/parm tournedos) was good, but not AMAZING, plus it was not cooked as requested, which was a bit of a bummer. The sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, where really good. The creme brulee and choc espresso cake, were both great as well. So, overall the food was solid, but again, not AMAZING The service by our waiter on the other hand... left us a bit sour: - He spoke really fast and we felt rushed, even though not many people were dining - He sighed and rolled his eyes when we (a table of 6) split the bill 6 ways on cards Overall, 3 stars.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"A great experience! Made my reso through yelp, and let them know we had a show to catch at 7pm. The hostess was very accommodating, asked if I wanted a booth and a booster seat, or a table and a high chair for my 2 year old. Since it was restaurant week, I ordered off that menu. I enjoyed a Caesar salad, and the filet with herbed butter and jumbo shrimp. My MR steak was a minute over cooked, but it was still absolutely delicious. The shrimp were nicely cooked, just wish it would have came with a sauce. We also shared mashed potatoes spinach and corn. All delicious.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"My steak was COLD when it was served from the kitchen. How could it possible? Even our server didn't pay attention to our table after he served the dishes. The place was not that busy with few people even though it was Friday evening. Furthermore, the server didn't seem to give us good suggestions/information when I asked them to recommend good wine and entree. I paid $200 for this dinner with my friend, but I don't feel like services and quality of steak deserve that much $$ bill. The only reason why I give them 3 stars, nevertheless, is oysters that we chose for appetizers were so fresh, thumb up. Don't think I'm coming back to this place again. I might just go to Del Frisco or Quality Meats nearby.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
Went here for a late night dinner with a group. The service was fantastic with lots of attention. They offered great meal suggestions. Had the sirloin steak and it was cooked to perfection. Had ordered medium rare and it was just right. The side dishes are plenty and are great for family style sharing. We were the last people in the restaurant and they did not rush us in any way.

"The Capital Grille is one of the many New York steakhouses serving the Midtown business lunch crowd. I enjoyed a leisurely lunch here for a ladies event - so unfortunately, I didn't get full reign of the menu. Service was impeccable, with prompt orders taken for drinks and entrees (from the prix fixe menu) and quickly clearing away plates. They were cognizant of the efficiency required for our large group and were available when we needed help. that said, I wish the water was filled more often. The space is dark, rich, and masculine. I love the high ceiling of the bar and the plush leather chairs. The area they put our group in though, was private in nature, but noisy, as we were seated in the mezzanine level where the voices of other diners bounced up and over us. I wish they had a small private room, but oh well. The food was good. I had the shrimp salad, which was very fresh, had a large portion, and was well dressed. There was a lot of iceberg lettuce, so I wish it was broken up more with other greens or add ins to make it less monotonous. The clam chowder was excellent, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the desserts and coffee. I really really wanted to try the steak, but that will have to wait for another time! This gets an A-okay for business party lunches, and I'll probably round up once I can order without being judged by the other dainty ladies.",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"Came here  a few nights ago with a group of friends. First off there is a few scary things on the menu, like the size of the wine menu! Holler Back!  Awesome selection of wines from all over the world.  Even offer Mag size bottles for large tables.  The other scary thing is all the calories on the menu. Really makes you think twice and then just not care when you realize your steak is 1000 calories!! yikes To start: Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella: this was ok, not fantastic. They pan fried it, so it took away from the crispness you usually have Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil Salad w/12 yr aged balsamic: this was fantastic, the balsamic was super tasty and the dish was fabulous Oysters: Nice, meaty oysters, very good Main: I had the 'Chef's Suggestions': Tenderloin w/Lobster: This dish was very good, but the presentation of the steak was bazaar, they chopped it into two cubes instead of one piece of meat, this left the meat over cooked on one half and perfect on the other cube. The lobster was awesome. ** Lobster: this was a huge platter of lobster, but the took the hard part out of it for you (it lay on-top of the shell) ** Swordfish: Nice size cut of fish, seasoned well ** Veggie Pasta: I think its a crime not to order meat at a steak house, but we had a vegetarian, the pasta was HUGE in portion, looked good, but not as good as the steak!! Sides: Green Beans: nice flavor, fresh tasting Portabella, Shitake, and oyster mushrooms: Fantastic!! Great mix, perfectly marinated Sauteed Spinach: trying to be somewhat healthy, this was not a favorite of the table, seemed soggy Parmesan Truffle fries: addictive!! Asparagus: Very nice, large pieces Wines: We had two nice bottles, both from Cali both reasonably priced $~55-85",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"We came here for dinner on our last night I'm NYC and right before our Jersey Boys show. My dad made a reservation, but for some reason they didn't have any record of it. Thankfully, it was early and there was no crowd. Our waiter was really good! Gave suggestions, was helpful, and very accommodating. The bread basket they serve is so good! It had 4 different varieties and each was freshly made, soft, and yummy. I ordered the Chilean Seabass in a tomato broth ($45). It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The fish was perfectly cooked and the tomato broth made the fish flavorful and moist. I savored ever bite. My family ordered the steaks (kona crusted and the rib-eye). We all agreed that the kona crusted steak was better. It had good flavor and was pretty tender. Our sides were decent, but nothing out of this world. The lemon oil asparagus and the mashed potatoes. I'm definitely happy I ordered my fish. And the bread was also very tasty. I couldn't stop eating it. Fairly expensive place, but we all enjoyed the meal overall.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

Beer selection was a little lacking. But, this isn't a beer place. It was quite and relaxing dinner. The staff was very friendly and warmed up to me nicely. Almost overly so. Great date place. For a person of one on business, not so much. Close to Time Square, but off the beaten path enough that you don't get all the excitement interrupting your dinner.

"For a Restaurant Week dinner, I was so impressed by what Capital Grille had to offer! I normally don't participate in RW because portions are smaller and the quality is never as good as ordering from the regular menu, but the food was delicious and the portions were great. I had the clam chowder, bone in kona and the creme brulee for dessert and everything was delicious. Good portions of clams in the soup and there wasn't an overload of potatoes. The steak was ridiculously amazing. It was cooked exactly the way I ordered it and I couldn't have eaten it any faster. I'm normally not a fan of sauce on my steak, but it was a perfect combination and really added to the overall steak. The creme brulee was so good and rounded out the meal perfectly. The service was great, but I really didn't expect anythign less out of the service. They did hand us our bill right away, but we ignored it and finished our wine and had a few minutes of conversation. I will say the quality and service does not change from location to location. The Kansas City location was great and so was this one. I will gladly come back to Capital Grille again, both for RW and for regular dining. An awesome fancy pants place that will keep you full and satisfied.",5.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"What: My birthday celebration When: Jan 17,2013 Time of reservation:7:30pm Time we were seated:8pm When we got there around 7:30pm, we were immediately told to check in our coats and wait on the side. Knowing that its a high end restaurant and quite classy, we expected to be seated immediately. But NO, that didn't happen. I have asked the hostess three times when our table is gonna be ready. She answered and said 5 more minutes. 2 more minutes. A couple more minutes.(respectively)  And when I looked at the time, wooah! 30 mins already passed! Asked her again for the fourth time. And thank heavens! We were lead to our table. We were seated 3 tables away from the restroom near the stairs. Its a very cozy and intimate spot actually. Not bad! When we got to our table, it was decorated with confetti and there was a birthday card as well! (SO SWEET! And unexpected) we were then greeted by a waiter/busboy, filled our glasses with water and greeted me a happy birthday:) . After a couple minutes, our waiter arrived to get our orders. We personally loved our waiter! He's very nice! Ask for him when you eat here! His name is Mulcy,he's very sweet and he'll make your time here unforgettable(just like ours). Service was really fast and gave me and my friends ample time in between courses for us to enjoy each course. What we ordered: Appetizer: Clam chowder Green salad Entrée with sides: (2) In bone kona cooked medium With mashed potatoes and cream spinach (2) Salmon with mashed potatoes Dessert: Ice cream and creme brûlée(with a pink candle) After serving dessert, Mulcy(our waiter) took a photo of us with the restaurant's camera and even gave us a copy of the photo! (Another plus plus) All in all the food tasted so good!With large portions too.The dessert was the best part of the meal, creme brûlée tasted so good!!! And we were so full (couldn't even finish our entrée). And all in all the experience was very memorable. They will really take care of you especially if you're the celebrant(wink wink) .

"Fancy but very pricey.  Portion sizes are huge but sides are not included in your order.  You may want to get steak or seafood here since that is what they are known for.  The food itself was pretty good, especially their coconut creme pie, but we felt like it was not worth the price.  If you can afford it, you're like paying more for the ambiance & top notch service (when we were done, a guy came by with a comb to wipe crumbs off the table; this is the first time I've seen this).",3.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

The pasta in the mac and cheese was very hard, no where near al dente and the calamari was lukewarm. It must've been sitting in the kitchen for awhile before being brought out. I ordered the sirloin steak with salad for my entree. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium, as I ordered it. The salad was so boring; I could've made it at home. It was also doused with dressing.

I ordered the filet mignon done au poivre style and my mister also had the filet, but he had his done with Cajun seasoning. His steak had great flavor. Mine was perfectly cooked and tender but a little bland apart from the pepper. I also found the sauce to be underwhelming. We had he creamed spinach and the fingerling potatoes as our sides. The spinach was good: standard steakhouse fare. The potatoes were extremely underdone. As we were keeping our eye out for our server, the manager, Melissa, stopped by to check on our meal. We told her about the potatoes and she offered to get us something else. We chose mashed potatoes because they would come out right away. Sure enough. She was back in about a minute. Overall it was a good experience even though I wasn't crazy about my steak. Our server, Tatiana, was excellent. They took the fingerling potatoes off our tab and comped the mashed potatoes.

Restaurant Week makes it easier to enjoy these gems in Manhattan. The reservation was easy. The service was prompt and professional. The food was high quality. The selections on the Restaurant Week menu were from the upper tiers of the menu but not the top. Very smart move. That gave the server a place to up sell that would make the guests happy.

Upgraded and added extra $10 for the bone-in, kona crusted sirloin and was completely disappointed. Meat was cooked fine but it was tough and pretty bland. Also, it did not say on the menu it came covered in au poivre -and that pretty much ruined it for me as it tasted like a heavy cream sauce was on every bite.

This second time was a horrible dining experience.  Why?  It was because our server, Jimmy, never cared to attend to our table once he took our order from the Theater Menu.  I mean I get it our meal is cheaper vs. the average finance guy who's charging it on their company AmEx but that's no excuse to treat your customers poorly.  We still spent about $150 out the door.  I won't be heading back to Capital Grille as I'm fine paying more to head over to Del Frisco's, which has way better steak and WAY BETTER SERVICE.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Had dinner here on a Friday night before a show, the service was amazing, Samantha, was our server and did a great job. We had the lobster crab cakes for an appetizer and they were near perfect, moist, great balance of lobster and crab. For main dishes we had the surf and turf and the scallops. Being blunt, the cook on fish station needs to be fired or demoted to commis. The scallops were not a little over cooked, they were grossly over cooked as was the lobster tail with the surf and turf. Both dishes should have never left the kitchen. This is amateurish and what you would expect from Applebee's, not The Capital Grille.

"First off, I am not a big review-type person, but I felt this was necessary. We have all been to a steakhouse and know the standard fare. At first glance, this is what The Capital Grille appears to be, another run-of-the-mill upscale steakhouse. However, the food was lackluster in comparison. The starters we chose (French Onion Soup and the Wedge Salad) were definitely the highlight of the meal. The soup was delicious and the wedge was flawless. If I was in the neighborhood, I would consider dropping in for these and a glass of wine. Maybe. For our entree, my date and I shared the porterhouse steak and lobster mac 'n cheese. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare, as requested, and had a good taste but was very much at room temperature. Not hot or warm in the slightest. That wasn't great. The noodles in the mac 'n cheese seemed to have been boiled for about 2 minutes - very hard. And the crisp on top and lack of sauce did not help in any way. Only made the noodles worse. The waiter seemed to be very new and unprofessional. There was another employee at the table next to us listening to his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones (not really sure why he was still there if he wasn't actually working), and the two of them started laughing as our waiter (Jeffrey) was telling us the specials. He did not enhance the meal in any way and did not visit our table nearly enough to see how everything was. I never send food back at restaurants. I believe it is a risk you take when you choose to walk into a restaurant. If it's not good, lesson learned and you don't go back. If it is good, you go back. Simple. In this case, I will not be going back.",2.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille
"This is the first time that I've been to Capital Grille and it was a really nice experience.  My friend and I came here on the last day of Restaurant Week.  I made a 5:30PM reservation since we had an 8:00PM Broadway show to attend close by. Firstly, the restaurant, located in the Time-Life Building, is spacious and very comfortable.  The color pallet is rich, dark earth tones of browns, black & mahogany. The walls are covered with large paintings, portraits and a few deer heads.  I didn't find the lighting too dim. The waiter we had was excellent.  He was prompt, attentive and most importantly, unobtrusive.   We both ordered the Caesar salad to start and the 10 oz. Filet Mignon with grilled jumbo shrimps ($10 extra).  My friend wanted her steak medium well and I wanted medium rare, being told that the middle would still be a cool pink. We both ordered one of their signature cocktails.  My friend had The Bohemian, peach vodka, berry cordial topped with champagne and I had The Stoli Doli, Stolichanya vodka infused with fresh pineapple. Both drinks were kind of watered down with mostly the fruit taste coming through.  When my friend complained that she could not taste the alcohol in her drink, the waiter brought it back to the bartender and then returned and told us that the bartender said the drink was made to the restaurant's exact specifications, period. My friend ordered a Sidecar instead and was happy with that. The Caesar Salads that we both had were average.  They lacked flavor and the dressing wasn't any better.  They were very cold and tasted as if they were pre-made and sat in the refrigerator. The steaks were well seasoned and tasty.  We found that both our steaks however, were slightly overcooked.  Mine more so.  Instead or medium rare, it was a definitely medium.  Both still very edible though.  The shrimps were nicely cooked and juicy. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake with the caramelized brulee and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  Both were very good but not exceptional. All in all, it was a very good dining experience.  The waiter made a big difference and the special pricing for Restaurant Week of $38 definitely made it a deal.  I would go back and try the other items on their very big menu.  My only gripe is the cocktails.  I was surprised that the restaurant did not do anything for my friend after she sent the drink back and ordered something different.  Anyway, I'd still recommend this restaurant as a place to try and would give it 3 1/2 stars.",4.0,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020",The Capital Grille

"Pros: quick service (in my case), location next to Times Square, menu with plenty of options Cons: AC was very weak, no customer WIFI, some pasta dishes are just okay (nothing amazing) It's fleet week 2018 in NYC and after visiting the ships docked in Piers 90-92, we walked to this Olive Garden to take a break from the summer heat. Big mistake! The AC in this location is barely noticeable. Even after sitting here throughout our meal we are just barely comfortable. Please don't come here if you're sweating and want to cool off: you won't. The menu is good, main reason we decided to stop by. You get free breadsticks and salad (refills) with your entree, so it's a great value. Dishes also have good portions. You'll find salad, soup, pasta, chicken, fish and meat dishes, plus a good array of drinks. There is no free WiFi, in case you are looking for a location with it.

"I love love Olive Garden! So much! But the Times Square location was the worst I have been too. The food was still good. Tiramisu here my absolute favorite. Their breads weren't fresh. I half come to this place for their soft and warm breads! But they ruined it this time. The main thing that actually Made my experience worst was our server! He was the worst I have ever seen. Extremely rude, least interested in everything so so grumpy! It's almost like he didn't even want to be there. I honestly have no complaints about the food except for the bread but that server shouldn't be there and should just go home if he's not interested in being there.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I went to the Olive Garden for the first time a few weeks ago. This location is decent sized, nice environment, friendly staff. We ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and Mozzarella sticks for appetizers. Both of these were amazing. The stuffed mushrooms are an appetizer you can't find just anywhere, I'd definitely recommend them if you're a fan of mushrooms. For entrees, we ordered the 6oz Sirloin with Fettuccine Alfredo cooked medium, and the Braised Beef Bolognese. These entrees were alright, the steak was kind of dry and was over cooked than what I asked for, and the fettuccine was bland. The beef bolognese was a little better, more flavourful at least. I don't think I would recommend the food here, maybe the appetizers but that's about it.

I remember coming here as a teen thinking, OMG Olive Garden in Times Square is so freaking cool! I've grown out of that. Thank f***. Coming back recently was not fun. The food was bland and mediocre and tasted like it had been microwaved, and it was expensive. The waiter was so busy that he was curt with us. Not like, Curt Smith from TFF. Way less cool. And Roland wasn't there to like, make the experience better. I was offered no Advice For The Young At Heart, and the whole place was so busy it felt like a Mad World. Plus all the waiters were fighting over tables so I guess Everybody Wants To Rule The Mad World. There's so many other better and cheaper Italian restaurants in NYC. Don't let the flashing lights fool you. I'm appaled by people that ever eat at this franchise chain, just like I'm appalled by people that spell appalled ""appaled.""

"While I had an ""alright"" but honestly pretty mediocre meal at this location, the checks provided at this Olive Garden at Time Square are massively deceptive. The check omits listing the base pre-tax cost and applicable sales tax of a meal (I am pretty sure this is illegal), pre-calculates an 18% tip that is immutable even though it says ""Suggested 18% Gratuity"", instead listing the COMBINED amount (inclusive of the tip) under the heading ""SubTotal"". That's not what a subtotal is. I ordered a shrimp pasta which came to ~$22, and the ""subtotal"" somehow comes to $29. If I wasn't careful, it then *seems* like you're supposed to add a tip ON TOP of the amount with the pre-calculated tip. Given that this is a location in Times Square where there are plenty of unsuspecting tourists who probably don't speak English, I'm sure the restaurant relies on these scammy tactics heavily. This is precisely the same kind of behavior one encounters on shady airline websites that pre-tick boxes for you where you have to actively opt-out of things you didn't even want. I was really excited to try Olive Garden, but this was my first and certainly last time. I hope this location goes out of business.",1.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I feel like I've attempted in the past but it was never an option so that in and of itself was great. With that said, I was pretty skeptical on food quality taking into consideration that I've only ever eaten in their restaurants. I couldn't have been more impressed. Salad dressing [and croutons] served on the side, they even included the Romano cheese to top it off. Their infamous breadsticks came warm and yes, actually fluffy. The main course also showed up looking fresh & delicious.

"Yesterday, I went through the most traumatic experience at a restaurant in my life! After working out with my friend, we were really hungry and wanted some good pasta. First place that came to mind was Olive Garden! My friend says let's go to the one on 6th Ave and 22nd St. We got there to find out that Olive Garden is no longer open for business. As our hunger grew, we still wanted Olive Garden and went to the Times Square location. We finally arrive very excited and starving! In ordered the bean soup and salad for starters, and the five cheese marinara spaghetti dish with grilled chicken. It's my favorite dish there! I ate some of the soup and then started to put some of the salad on my plate. Out of the salad, a roach comes flying out and lands onto my plate of spaghetti! What started off as a dream of having my favorite pasta dish, now turned into a nightmare! I couldn't believe what I was seeing and looked to see if there were more of them. I suddenly got sick to my stomach and wanted to vomit. The people next to us looked over in shock and disbelief of what was happening. How does something like this happen? My friend and I were having such a good time hanging out and then this turned out day upside down! We had wanted some Olive Garden so bad and were so turned off by what just happened. At this point, we called the waitress over and told her what happened. She quickly took our plates away and then a manager came over. He asked if we wanted something else to eat, but after that why would we eat anything else that comes out of that kitchen? Where there is one roach, there are a lot more! We were so disgusted because my friend had eaten some of the salad, where the roach came from, and myself the soup. We both could have eaten a roach! That's so crazy! We went home feeling nauseous but still hungry. The image of the roach coming out of the salad is something I'll probably never forget! I'll probably never go back to an Olive Garden again meaning I'll never get to enjoy the salad and spaghetti dish I love so much. They're both tied to a bad memory! Thanks Olive Garden!  I'm sharing this with you my friends so that this doesn't happen to any of you as well! Olive Garden is a popular place and I know so many people who love going there. I had posted about this on my Instagram stories and they asked me if a manager helped us out. I'm sorry but eating anything else from a place that has roaches wasn't happening!

Since it has been a while since my  visit (like I mentioned earlier this review is long long overdue ) I really don't remember the entree I had. I do remember the salad and bread stick.

"Back during my college years I used too lunch with a friend who always wanted to go because she loved the breadsticks, this always struck me as peculiar. We usually ordered the salad as well and on this past visit I went with a favorite of mine, Eggplant Parmagian. Served over a spaghetti pasta that had no texture at all. Pasta needs a rib, a wrinkle or krinkle to hold the sauces. Thin wrinkles for thin sauces, thicker ribbing for thicker sauces and so in. Served in a very quick manner as both items were approaching, I saw the eggplant sat lightly upon the slippy pasta. There were no mid to larger sized cuts, only the smaller ones. I feel the eggplant must have been sliced a day or two before as they were limpish and over-cooked. Almost eviscerated in the low octane frying oil, there was a forced attempt too crisp.

"Service was very odd and we were overcharged by $60 without explanation. We were a group of 7 and we're told it would take over 45 minutes, which would be a major turnoff for some groups, but we were all happy from the day of touring and went upstairs to find that most of the seating area was actually empty and they were seating up right away. We put our beverage order in but then the server's shift was probably ending and he switched with another waiter who seemed put off from the start. Two of our guests had decided not to order anything more than soda (for religious reasons), so the fact that the total was substantially over $200 before tax or tip was strange. This is setting aside issues some of us had with dirty cups and straws that were somehow sealed shut. It was an interesting experience. Another member of the group asked for a (simple) alfredo pasta from the ""make your own pasta"" options and the server complained that the order would take at least 10 minutes. We asked him to please include it in our order. The whole grain pasta option lacked flavor and no one came to see how we were doing until after the bill was settled. I wasn't left a copy of the receipt  after paying, but also didn't want to make a big fuss with all my guests there. The bill came once at the rate of $150, which made sense, but the waiter left and came back with a bill for over $200 and disappeared when I paid cash. No receipt, nothing.

"People love to make jokes about Olive Garden and about how it is not authentic Italian. Yet people keep coming here. Anytime I have been there is a wait time of 20-40 minutes. I think Olive Garden knows they are not authentic and that they cater to an American palate. You have to think of it like a different type of Italian cuisine. Anyway, the views at this location are cool and perfect for people watching and pointing out crazy freaks one after the other on Times Square. The views contribute to the overall ambiance, the restaurant is on several floors and very spacious between tables. I have had chicken and pasta dishes here, they are quite filling. The soup and salad is good too. One time I had salad which is endless, I gave some of it to my wife, the server comes over and tells me its endless only for the person who ordered it and I can't give it to someone else. Then something something he will let it go for this time. I was like whatever and gave my wife some more salad the moment the server turned away. Don't think anyone appreciates being told off when spending money, and not over something as minimal as a piece of lettuce. They always try to sell you a bottle of wine by offering you a small sample glass. They offer everyone at the table 1/5 of a glass, I just gather everyones glasses and pour them into one and TADA I have a free glass of wine. Just kidding.

When we first got there my daughter went in the ladies room. She told me it was filthy with every trash can overflowing, including the ones in the stalls for sanitary products. Discusting !  She told the host about it and they said they would take care of it. 1 1/2 hours later when we were leaving, I went to the ladies room and  NOTHING had been done. When we were being seated we passed SEVERAL booths but they seated us at a table. When I asked if we could have one of those booths he said ""NO, you'll have to go and wait in line all over again.

"We came here because we needed a restaurant that would make everyone happy.  We usually have a rule that we will not eat at a restaurant we eat at back home but we know what we are getting when we dine at Olive Garden.  We came for lunch.  Sometimes when you dine in a tourist area they don't have things like lunch specials but we were happy to find that this one did.  I had the famous soup, salad and breadsticks.  I was rogue and had the pasta fagiole soup instead of the minestrone.  The teen had her go-to fettucini alfredo and salad.  Hubby had lasagna.  The lunch entrees are lunch size which is good, since Italian food can be so rich.  Service was okay.  4 stars because they delivered exactly what we were after!",4.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner. It was not very busy but the service was pretty slow. Our waitress disappeared half the time we were there. I came here for the never ending classic deal. I did not know each dish was priced differently. It was also not worth it because I got full from waiting for the waitress to come back to order the next serving. We also ordered the braised beef and gnocchi. The beef was tender and soft. I would recommend it.,3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Now let me first start by saying this review has an uptick more or less because of the incredible view. Olive Garden is a chain restaurant and as such it's nothing overly special. The food was good, but just like what you'd get at any Olive Garden. What made this place amazing was the view. Right in the heart of Times Square with seating on two levels. We were lucky enough to have a table on the second floor with an amazing view of Times Square itself.

I have not been to a Olive Garden in years. That is because there are not any near my work. Just happen to be in Times Square so I decided to drop in and have a quick bite. Had the soup and salad many times over the years and it did not change much. The soup was a little salty but overall ok and does the trick for lunch.

"It might seem odd to choose a cross-country restaurant chain in one of the nation's biggest food-loving cities. However, the comfort Olive Garden Chicken Alfredo brought me on a cold day in the city cannot be measured.

I was immediately brought bread and salad, even before being brought a drink. The food was not marked up in price due to location, which I appreciated.

"Came here with my son, 23. We love the Olive Garden. I take their advertising message of ""family"" very seriously. As such, I have been to many Olive Garden locations and always try to friendly with the managers and staff. I also make myself available to them for airport pick-up like a real family does. However, I rely on my son for driving and so the one time I was asked I had to politely decline and eat at Applebee's for a few weeks out of embarrassment. Anyway, we were heading to New York City so my son can pick up a Nintendo Switch and get his photograph taken with an unemployed actor dressed like Spidermin. I realized we had never eaten at the flagship Olive Garden in Time's Square. I heard the singers like Frank Sinatra used to eat there. We arrived and were promptly seated. I was worried the prices would be insane, as I know NYC is still paying reparations for its involvement in the Spanish American war and as such has prices higher than many other cities. As a family, we like to play a lot of games at mealtimes. However, Olive Garden provides at-table video games. We played these while consuming a vast amount of salad. My son (23) has a form of celiac disease so we get our salads without croutons. The salads were crisp and fresh and I enjoy digging out the olives and discarding them, while my son loves to put the pepperoncinis in his jowls and recite lines from classic television. Our server hooked us up with a fistful of the after dinner mints. My son had the Tour of Italy. I had the five cheese ziti. No alcohol due to the presence of Bushmills. 5 stars.",4.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Warning. On receipt I wrote to lower tip due to painful performance. Waiter gave himself 18% anyway! -- Portions were surprisingly small, like why didn't we just make this ourselves small. Got ""unlimited soup"" with entree. It was nice and joked I'd only get one. After 15 min having an empty soup bowl asked Waiter ""more bread and soup plz"" Bread came 5 min later and he ran off I was wondering if I'd get soup 5 min later I asked if my soup was coming. ""Check?"" He asked ""Soup and fine check"" I said Soup finally came 5 min later with no check He came back asking if we wanted desserts I said ""no check plz"" Check came with automatic 18% gratuity and no pen to change it but thanx to my crafty fiancé she had her own pen to outsmart them! Yet he handed it back and said that instead of taking it off his tip part of his check I just needed to write -1.59 under the total while putting a hand on my shoulder. Wow personal space! We still gave 15% and thought we spent 40 on decent food at embarrassing portions and chalkboard screeching service. While feeling like we had to beg for our portions. Leaving us so emotionally drained that it ruined our vacation day. Update - he charged us at 41.59 which I did not agree to. That's illegal! I didn't even want to give him the 15% tip and he stole money from me. And now I feel like an idiot complaining over 1.50 Ugh.

For the main course we got the Northern Tour of Italy and the Cucina Mia - whole wheat linguini with crispy chicken and Asiago alfredo. The whole wheat overpowered the taste of the sauce so probably would not get it again. Northern tour was delicious. Only downside was that we went for the never ending pasta which was ending on 11/22 and we went on 11/21. However the Times Square location ended it early and it's not posted anywhere! Really disappointed. Additionally we wanted to get the bread stick chicken parm sandwich which is also advertised on the website but the waiter said its being phased out next week so they couldn't do it for us. Pretty sure the guy at the next table had a sandwich and fries.. Hm. Also this location is way more expensive than in NJ suburbs. Each dish is anywhere from $2-$6 more.

When I asked why it took so long to get a soda refill he said: ""oh, I have a big group... they ordered everything from the menu!"" - my bill was over 80$ for food that was not restaurant quality (you can get better pasta at whole foods)... we got the unlimited salad option and when we wanted more salad... our waiter was no where to be found- I had to get up and ask a different waiter... overall- I was very disappointed! Keep in mind this was my first time at an olive garden ""restaurant"" and probably my last! The pasta I got was full of oil and terrible. They have a 14.99 pasta special where you get to select your own pasta, sauce and topping (chicken, shrimp etc)... very misleading- and toppings are not part of the $14.99... they are listed in small font next to the calorie count. Now, I was fasting all day and was waiting all day to indulge in some delicious food- but I was extremely disappointed! When i asked the server why the chicken was an extra $5 and where was it listed so I know for the future- he says: ""you think I am trying to slip some extra charges to your bill?"" I was like: ""no he did not go there!""

"I don't know what it is that makes Olive Garden the butt of so many jokes. I've always found the food here to be consistently decent. Yes, it's not your gourmet dishes from Sicily. There are places for that in New York. Here you get decent Italian at great prices. It also takes me back to my childhood in the 90's when going to the OG was a thing. Free unlimited breadsticks and salad or soup is such a selling point. The pasta e fagioli and salad are delicious actually!! I also love the breadsticks, which are freshly baked and come wrapped in a fresh napkin. My friend and I came to this location just for the experience of dining in Times Square. Take an elevator to the top floor to get seated. It's a a fairly large space but I can see this place filling up quickly. 1. Tour of Italy: your choice of three items. We got the fettuccini Alfredo, lasagna, and chicken Marsala ravioli. All 3 items were decent and filling. We enjoyed the variety. It's also under $20. 2. Stuffed mushrooms: decent as an appetizer. Not too salty with good texture. 3. Beef and chicken ravioli: these were surprisingly delicious! Little savory bites that can be dipped in marina sauce. Take a stroll down memory lane.

"Ahhh good old OG! As I've mentioned in previous reviews of Darden Restaurants, I used to work at Olive Garden back in the day so before my lunch here I was prepared to critique up the whazoo! To start, this location is in time square so right off the bat you need to prepare yourself with higher prices and gratuity automatically added on EVERY check... Yes that means every single one, not just parties of 8 or more.  This location is one of the largest restaurants I've ever been in... 3 stories!  We made a reservation for 1 PM in advance and got sat on the third floor.  This was great because there are large windows overlooking time square which is a really nice view (unless you hate it there.)  Decor is your typical Olive Garden- kinda more cheesy than nice.   Overall it's a large, spacious, CLEAN Olive Garden. Here are a few highlights from our lunch: -Our server Cathy was amazing- very sweet and did NOT cut corners! I had my eye out for that since it's very easy to do that while working there.  When I asked for extra kale in my soup, she brought it.   She was also on top of it with salad, bread, and drink refills! -The breadsticks there were seriously the best Olive Garden breadsticks I've ever had.... I've been to many locations all over the country, and for some reason these were little pieces of heaven in a basket.  Warm, soft, buttery... Ahhh-mazing! -This was quick service, we got there at 1 PM and were done by 1:45.  It wasn't that they were pushing us to leave, they were just on top of it with attentiveness and service. You really can't go wrong with their unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks combo- it's so yummy and a great deal (even for time square prices.) My only complaint about the experience is Olive Garden no longer has ranch dressing!! Boo!

"This is the worst place to choose for dinning in the city. The restaurant is incredibly dirty inside. The quality of service is terrible (the waitress  brought the water only after I asked after 10 min of waiting, also we had been two and she brought only one glass and never refilled that glass back), and the food nothing special. And also the worst, they automatically charge your bill with 18% of gratuity and do not leave you the choice to leave the amount of tips according to the service they deserve . I know that gratuity is added because of tourists but  you should know that YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED TO PAY THE GRATUITY UNLESS IT IS PARTY OF 6 OR MORE AND THEY DO  NOT HAVE RIGHT TO ADD IT AUTOMATICALLY TO YOUR CHECK! moreover considering their poor quality of service even 10% of tips is too much!",1.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"We all know Olive Garden isn't stellar Italian food, but it's usually pretty good if you're really craving it or if you're in a touristy area and need a consistent go-to.  We stopped here on a Sunday evening, and there was a 45 minute wait.  We were given a pager and told we could wait at the bar upstairs, but we found it was way too crowded up there.  Before heading back downstairs I grabbed a Coke at the bar...it was the most disgusting Coke I've ever had.  Super watery, not fizzy at all.  On the way back to the bar to get something to replace the Coke, we  noticed that the restaurant was really dirty.  There were dropped napkins and food scraps all over the floors and it looked like nobody had swept in days.  At this point we really didn't want to eat here and decided to leave.  I understand that this is a super crazy location, but you would think they'd take extra care to clean up a bit and make the restaurant look semi-presentable. And after experiencing the quality of the fountain drinks I didn't really want to stick around to try the food.  I've been to good Olive Gardens but this one seems to be a not so good one.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"New York-minute review 5/5: ""Come I to speak in Olive Garden's funeral. It was familiar to me and my family, and reliable for food that was good. We all did love it once, not without cause. My heart is in the coffin there with Olive Garden, And I must pause till it come back to me."" ..... Okay.  That's enough. Now let me tell you---a lot has changed since the last time we were here.  A LOT. I sensed something was up when at 6:30 P.M. there were many empty tables.  In the past, the place was packed at that hour, with many more waiting to get in. Our waiter was this older dude with little personality.  And that personality was NYC taxi driver.  Not the bubbly, energetic, eager-to-please waiter/waitress we'd come to expect from previous visits. We weren't that hungry so ordered a bunch of app's---stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella, 5 Italian cheese fonduta, and crispy risotto bites.  The fried mozzarella, and risotto bites were OK.  The others, meh. I tried to cancel my ""create your own"" pasta of rigatoni + garlic white wine + grilled chicken.  Without skipping a beat or batting an eye, Mr. Personality tells me the order has already been placed.  ?!  Gee, thanks for really trying to accommodate this diner's wishes. So I get my pasta.  No offer of fresh ground parmesan or pepper.  I see a matching set of condiment bottles---balsamic vinegar and olive oil---sitting on the window sill above us.  ?!  The bottles look dirty, and the olive oil is discolored.  I ask Mr. Personality for another set.  Again, without batting an eye, he tells me ""that's the only one we have.""  ?!  Really?!  The pasta was MEH.  The few bites of it I took that is.  About as good as the Hawaiian Airlines ""hot meal."" For that experience Mr. Personality tried to tack on a 20% gratuity.  HELL TO THE NO!  I had him re-do the check. This place may still have a pulse.  But it's weak and thready.  It's appropriate that the waiters and waitresses now wear all black.  Better update your resume too Mr. Personality.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

We started off with the Blackberry Blood Orange Tea and the Orange Fruit Juice. The Blackberry Tea is the best. It was sweet and tasteful. It looks like a vampire drink haha. The Olive Garden is a bit pricey here and has wine. But don't forget to ask or the Never Ending pasta, which isn't on the menu. Must ask for it. The salad and breadsticks came. Breadsticks were salty and salad was the usual house salad. We had the fettuccine sausage pomodoro entree and an angel Asigo Garlic Alfredo entree with chicken fritta (extra $3 to add meat). The alfredo was very creamy. There was enough meat in the pomodoro. it took forever for me to finish the pomodoro. It was well-portion. It's a much bigger portion than the Gateway location.

"Came here for lunch on Tuesday, which was my last day in the city :( located slap bang in the middle of times square, its a nice italian restaurant. If you tell them you want a window table, they will take you upstairs and you can choose where to sit. I had the best seat in the house!!! Sitting right oppostite of the hustle and bustle! From different angles, you got different pictures. I took quite a few!! The lady brought out so many different menus, which were all a bit confusing, but they serve everything during lunch. Americans are known for extra large portions, so when our food came out, I was fine about it, cause they weren't too big!! But big enough that I couldn't finish it..... I went for ""create your own pasta"" with tri-coloured pasta with primavera sauce and sauteed shrimp. It was sooo good, the sace was creamy and tangy, packed full of vegetables and the right amount of shrimp, very flavoursome, very much like comfort food, homely style cooking, which I loved so much. Wasn't a fan of the roasted tomato sauce for the breadsticks, just tasted like a cheese sauce tbh. The fried mozarella sticks were sooo nice!!! But I've had the same at other places, so nothing new there. The service we received from the lady was on point, she kept coming over to make sure we were ok, and if we needed anything, you can add extras on the side with your main meal like extra vegetables etc. If you choose a small plate, then the extras are worth it! The cocktails were good too, I got the Sangarita, its like a sangria, red wine, rose, raspberry liqour and bitters, as much as I enjoyed sipping through it, not only was it huge, it was also one of the strongest on their menu!!!! Wayy tooo strong for my liking, i'm all about balance, this was not it for me! i had to squeeze a lemon and orange into it!!

"Walked in here on Sunday around 4:00 because I got a gift card for Chritmas, and I don't normally eat in chain restaurants, but I figured it would be free and i'd treat my sister. Well, first red flag was that they got a ""C"" from the department of health. Walked in and saw a dirty diaper on a cocktail table. Gross. Kept going and found out there was a 45 minute wait. Went upstairs with the beeper where i saw a GIANT ball of hair flying around on the floor. Waiters and waitresses just kept walking by both the diaper and the hairball. That was the final straw. I get it, they are busy, but COME ON! This place is absolutely filthy! If this is what is in the public areas, I cannot even imagine what their kitchen looks like! I felt sick just being there, never mind EATING there. My sister was also in shock at the utter lack of upkeep and the filth inside. Went walked a few blocks to Heartland Brewery, which got an ""A"" and was very clean, service was good, and the food was excellent. Out of curiousity my sister looked up their most recent violations on the NYC restaurant inspection after we came home, and found one of the violations was ""filth flies"" near the food and cross contamination of raw meats! This information is available for public viewing, I am not making this up! I cannot believe what they are charging for NYE! The management/owners should be ashamed. I don't even know how they are still in business, other than the location, but there are so many other options!!!!! Get out of there and go find them!!!

"I've only been to this location a couple of times - traditionally I go to olive garden in Kansas City or Overland Park. Today my boyfriend and I went for lunch and to celebrate the end of my finals (I am a student at Columbia). The service was okay - it was a little slow for my liking, but I suspect the server was trying to give my boyfriend and I space since we were on a date. At the end of the meal I realized that I was being attacked by a pesky mosquito that was buzzing around a few feet away from our table. Now, where I'm from, mosquito are everywhere and its not the end of the world. But, it did take me by surprise and irritate me some that I was suddenly covered in bug bites. I asked to see the manager, Ian, and briefly explained the situation to him. I'm not kidding, I felt like I was back in the Midwest. I haven't received hospitality or concern like what he offered since moving here last year. It wasn't that he offered to comp my lunch or that he apologized for the situation, though he did do those things, it was the WAY he handled the situation. It was the level of concern he showed and his compassion for the guests in the building. From the years of personal experience I've had, I've been taught that it isn't the bad situation that affects a guest's experience, its the way that it is handled.

You can come with family or friends . Good for groups and can celebrate your special dates. When we entered and asked  front desk about table for two ( me and my wife) the lady asked us to wait for 20 min because we didn't book reservation. So after that we got the nice table . Our waitress was pretty nice and brought house Italian wine for tasting.The wine was good, I ordered for that one but my wife ordered for margarita which was also fine. After that she brought us famous house  salad, hot soup and warm bread stick. I simply loved that salad specially that dressing.The best part that was unlimited and you can eat as much you want. My wife asked for minestrone soup which she liked it.After that we ordered crispy risotto bites and stuffed mushroom for an appetizer . If someone is vegetarian or prefer to eat gluten free food then this should be your place. You can find so many options which is really delicious. In main course we ordered garlic rosemary chicken and Ravioli di portobello,chicken was so soft,juicy and well cooked.

It seems like they know Olive Garden will provide bad services so they just add 18% gratuity to the bill so you can't pay less if the service is crappy.

"Disclaimer: Yes, I know you are reading a review about Olive Garden. You can give me dirty looks if you like but I still do like it, to a certain extent. This Olive Garden is the most expensive Olive Garden I've ever been to. Sure they have all those TV ads advertising 2 entrees for $25, but it does not apply here. One entree is about $25 actually. The good thing is that you get UNLIMITED breadsticks and salad. I LOVE THE BREADSTICKS. I love it so much that I actually take a bag home (and you are allowed to do this.) I also love the salad. I usually go through a few bowls with my friends. The dressing is delicious and I always get the waiter to shave some cheese on top of it. Don't judge me, I know I'm a fatass. For my main course, I had the garlic chicken. It came out rather tough. I'm not paying $25 for chicken that feels like I'm eating leather. We complained and they took our food, made new ones and brought it back. Thankfully it was softer this time but could be better. Next time though, I'm going to have a pasta dish because they make those much better.",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I usually have lower expectations for restaurants located in the epicenter of tourism; however, this Olive Garden left me pleasantly surprised. The place was packed with people on this rainy Saturday evening. Surprisingly, it was only a 15 minute wait before we were seated at our table for two on the 3rd floor. There were large windows that gave you views Times Square from every angle. Depending on where you are seated, you may have a different experience. Overall, the place was clean and the table turnover was at a steady pace. It took about 5 minutes after we were seated for our waiter to great us (longest 5 minutes ever). The waiter was great though. The food was also great and the portions were decent. We ordered a Filet Mingnon with Pesto sauce and vegetables that came with side garden salad as well as an Oven Baked Tilapia Parmasian with mashed potatoes and a side Turkey and Potatoe Soup... YUM!

"In my defense, I came here only because of a gift card. I might as well have had a frozen tv dinner. Not even defrosted, that would have been better. The practically flavorless garlic bread sticks where simply packaged mini baguettes ( they might as well have been hot dog buns)  brushed over the top with """"butter"""" and  sprinkled with garlic salt (seriously, how hard is it to make garlic butter?). Sheesh, someone even forgot to sprinkle the garlic salt on one of the hot dog buns . The chicken scampie was dry, bland chicken tenders, served over luke-warm, over-done, over salted, and oddly sweet tasting pasta . It was awkwardly topped with a mound of half raw sliced bell peppers. Why? I don't know. The cheese fondant was even more insulting. I keept thinking to myself "" is this a prank? Am I on a candid camera show?"" The fondant was literally just dried herbs and melted cheese, served with sesame melba toast. The toast had the complex flavors of the plastic sleeve it had been stored In,  probably a year ago.

"Not sure if it was nostalgia. Not sure if it was low expectations because of 300 page the Starboard Presentation summarizing how crappy Olive Garden has become, but they hit it out of the ballpark tonight. Unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks are still a staple. It was just as delicious as I remembered from my prior visit in 1996. We ordered the Eggplant parm and Chicken Scampi. To my surprise the eggplant parm was delicious. The eggplant was crispy, which is a nice change from the soggy eggplant most Italian restaurants serve. The chicken scampi was so-so. It could have used some crushed red pepper. The service was excellent. Victor M was our server and he was friendly, fast and helpful. I think Olive Garden is really doing their best to turn their franchise around. The manager came over and gave us here business card and made sure that the service and food was great. I think the reason why I gave Olive Garden a 4 star review was not only a compilation of everything above but also the way they finish out the meal. They give you thin mints. But to show they go the extra mile at Olive Garden, the thin mints were refrigerated, which made them more delicious.

We also got the Italian Trio which was alfredo fettuccine, chicken Parmesan, and beef lasagna.  This was a lot of food for the price and they were all what you expected them to be - classics without anything extra added in.

"What I looove about Olive Garden is their unlimited salad and breadsticks! Although not the breadsticks so much, they're mostly flavorless and act as filler). Seriously, every time I go, I have at least 2 bowls of salad. But then again, I know I'd rather fill up on vegetables than white carbs, and having unlimited salad is pretty generous nowadays when everything has a price. The price of the unlimited salad is, of course, ordering an entree. I like the Capellini Pomodoro with Chicken ($15.99 + $4.29) under ""Lighter Italian Fare."" It comes with a generous helping of pasta and the marinara sauce is good, if not a little plain. I am not a fan of the Chicken Parmigiana. The pasta is alright, but eating the fried chicken made me feel like I was going to have a heart attack. The menu has calorie counts, so I appreciate the honesty. Even though the CapPom only has 490 calories, it has 1250 grams of sodium, while the Chicken Parm has 1090 calories and 3380 grams of sodium, not to mention 18 grams of saturated fat. A heart attack, indeed! This particular location is busy, bustling and everything you can hope for from Times Square. Most of the tables have views of the happenings below. Even though everyone talks about the 30 min-plus wait, my advice is, time flies when you're at the bar drinking mediocre cocktails. Service is alright, but if you get a nonchalant waiter, the experience is less ""in-and-out"" than ""Crap! It took 2 hours to eat?! Eff my life.""

Really a 2 star for food but added a star because we had a great waiter who was on top of his game despite how many tables he had.  I guess since it's right in Times Square go for the sake of it's location and bear in mind that it's expensive for sub-par pasta.  The lure of unlimited salad and breadsticks is not worth the over all price.",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Metered parking is really expensive as well.",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"First of all, this place is decent due to its location alone, which is convenient to say the least if you are around time square area, especially as a tourist. The only catch is the wait time, anywhere between 20 min to 40 min depending on the time of day or whether it rains outside. However, if you are willing to venture out a little bit further out, there are tons more location to choose from with better food much more representative of NYC. Seriously, if you come to this city, I'm sure that you want something more unique than a big chain restaurant that you can easily find in your town across America. That being said, we had the never ending pasta bowl since me and my gf wanted to see what the hype is all about. To start off, we both ordered the Tuscan soup, it was adequate, with balanced seasoning. Still, reminded me of canned soup. Next comes the bread sticks. I know many reviewers rave about how good they are, but to be honest, these do not compare well even to ones I've had at the average Italian restaurant in NYC. I do not know if it was this particular batch, but they were way too salty. As if the baker forgot that he/she salted earlier and salted again, on top of the salted butter that was already on there. Next comes the pasta, and what we had been itching to try. Out of all the sauces you can pick from, we managed to try 5 of them, which is no easy feat considering that you have to finish all the pasta noodles before you get another one. But we will revisit the ridiculously rigid rules later. Of the 5 sauces, the 2 best were the asiago garlic alfredo and the meat sauce, other 3 were very plain. For $3 extra, we also got to add protein on the pasta. In summary, the meat ball was the best (balanced flavoring and tasted fresh), followed by the sausage (ours were burnt), then the chicken fritta (dry chicken). Now that the food is covered, here comes the rules for all you never ending pasta nOObs out there. Whatever you pick for the appetizer, salad or soup, cannot be changed when you order a second serving. If you order Tuscan soup to start, you cannot order any other flavor of soup or the salad. So choose wisely! Or if you have more than one person at the table, make each person pick a different one so someone else can ask you to re-order what you just had if they did not like their first choice! Second, the protein comes in 2s the first time, then in 1s starting from your second serving of pasta onwards. So first serving comes with 2 meatballs, second and third servings each only come with 1 meatball, even though the amount of pasta remains the same. Third, the gratuity is automatically included in bill no matter what the service is like. Which in our case was very generous considering that the waitress could not get our protein order correctly twice in a row (ordered meatball but all we got were sausages and got meatball when we ordered fritta). To top it off she actually made us pick the protein up ourselves before bringing the pasta back to kitchen to receive the correct protein. So overall, this never ending pasta deal is worth a try if you have never had it before. If you don't have much options around town, then it is worth a second look. But with all the other options in this city, once is more than enough for curiosity's sake. N.B. the pasta was cooked perfectly in all cases, no crunchy or soggy noodles, good job there OG",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Especially since we were celebrating a birthday. We all enjoyed our first course (Soup or Salad) and by the time out pastas came out we were enjoying our meal, and then the inevitable happened. I saw this movement out of my peripheral. I look to my left and what do I see crawling? A baby roach of course. It's only appropriate that we panicked due to that not being normal in our eyes. Sorry but in California having roaches is a health code violation.  We go to tell the hostess and she nonchalantly speaks into her speaker that we found a roach. WTH!!!!! is it not a big deal? the manager comes and says that they try their best to contain them and they spray 2x a week. . so you KNOW you have roaches. He offered to move us to another table (did I mention our table was right by the kitchen) which we adamantly declined. He asked us if we wanted our food redone, uhm absolutely NOT! so the manager, I guess understanding our plight finally, offered us a gift card and his apologies. As I waited for the manager to return what do i see? oh yea, another roach heading quickly towards the kitchen. GROSS!!!!!! Never again will i eat there! I don't know if roaches in restaurants in NY is the norm but that has definitely traumatized me. Disgusting. The nonchalant attitudes towards them was the greatest disappointment. Please, pay attention if you do decide to dine at this ""lovely"" establishment",1.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Ran in just before a matinee for a drink.  We sat at the bar and had two really great dirty martini's.   Everyone around us was eating lunch specials that looked great,  prices were so reasonable for food especially in Times Square. Asked how the food was and two people at the bar said they were regulars.     $14.99 for eggplant parm which came with a huge salad and breadsticks.   Everything smelled and looked good.  However I looked over the menu and if you are gluten free only a couple things to order.

"Jeez, what's with all the hate? I love Olive Garden (then again, this was my first time ever going to Olive Garden...so I may have been a tad overly enthusiastic newbie). I got a gift card to this place for my birthday and was eager to try it out. This is located in Times Square so plenty of space in the two floors they have. We were seated immediately. In terms of food: The salad was to die for (they even put whole peppers in it) and very unique. Tasted heavenly with the bread. I ordered the Garlic Rosemary Chicken and it was very savory and filling. Also, who doesn't love a side of mashed potatoes and spinach? Classic. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Mousse Cake with a Hazelnut Caramel Macchiato. Sadly enough, the Macchiato was actually a better dessert than the cake as it had plentiful whipped cream and was very sweet. The cake had its good, crumbly delicious parts but the ice cream in the middle tasted old as if it had just come out of the freezer. We ended up not finishing it. As for alcoholic drinks, I highly recommend the Moscato. So fruity and delicious (thus dangerous) you will drink them quickly and probably end up laughing uncontrollably on your way to the train station (or is that just me?). Service was very friendly and sweet. Of course, the prices are probably a repellent for the average New Yorker so I do understand the hesitation to come here rather than ""authentic"" Italian places. I was lucky that I had a gift card to mitigate my potential paralysis when the bill came (close to $100 without the card for two people) so I do have my bias.

The long lines are helped by the staff supplying you with the beepers that go off even if your not in the restaurant. You could also just relax at the bar where the bartenders are all very nice from my experience. When we sit down we are presented with menus and greeted politely. They make great suggestions , and are all very helpful and knowledgeable of what is on the menu and the ingredients. The salad given has always been lush and fresh. We always get a great waiter or waitress who ask us to sample several wines before picking the right one in which we buy the bottle ( Per Glass makes no sense in my opinion , esp since you can take the remainder home). I always order the Bruchetta and it is presented nicely and tastes great. Any Entrees we order have always tasted great with a very fair helping of food that I usually finish and enjoy the desserts are well crafted and presented nicely.

"Service: Awesome Decor: Not bad, clean Food: ... uh... Came to this place since I was in the area and it had been a while since I had stepped into an Olive Garden.  The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant looked huge from the outside! After going through the revolving doors, I was directed upstairs to the hosts stand, where I was immediately seated.  The waitress was energetic and friendly, asking us if we wanted to try any wines and took the order in a timely fashion.  It seemed to be a bit more upscale than the previous places I had been to in the past... And then the food came out. Sampler platter: I got calamari and stuffed mushrooms. The calamari was seasoned and breaded very well. However, the stuffed mushrooms were... bland. They looked good... but when eaten, not much flavor. I had to put on some of the tartar sauce/cocktail sauce they provided for the calamari just to be able to eat it. Tri-colored Vege Penne w/bacon and dried tomatoes:  it came out looking great and the waitress offered cheese to grade on the top, which made it look fantastic. However, I had the same problem again... there was very little flavor and the pasta was dry. It wasn't bad, but not something I would order again. Ah, as for the unlimited breadsticks and soup ( I ordered the chicken and gnocchi), I always liked the touch. I think it is normal for this chain to top-salt their breadsticks, but I always found them to be too salty and have to use a napkin to brush the salt off. And the soup? It was good and I used it to dip the breadsticks in for a good combination. I was full in the end, so didn't try the dessert.",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

The Alfredo sauce got rave reviews although I avoided it for dietary reasons. I wasn't overly impressed with my Parmesan baked shrimp pasta. It was good but not $22 worthy.

"There was a time in my life where I looooooved Olive Garden. (No joke, I was going about once every 2-4 weeks when I was a ""broke"" college student.) Perhaps over the years I have gained more wisdom, or perhaps the fact that I'm working has allowed me to sample more upscale (and authentic) Italian cuisine, but now the only time I ever come to OG, especially THIS OG, is for their Never Ending Pasta Bowls promotions. This particular OG's wait time is ridonkulus! On a good night, the wait time is 30 minutes. That's right, that's a ""good night"". I've stopped by before and heard wait times of up to 2 hours. Who has time??? I do like OG for their unlimited garlic breadsticks and salad. My first time eating salad ever was at OG (their house dressing is addictive!). Their drink selection is also pretty good. I can't say too much about the wines, but their cocktails and teas at least are on point. Their pastas aren't bad either, but I used to think they were the best stuff on earth. Now that I've eaten at a ton of other ""real"" Italian restaurants around the city, OG's pastas in comparison seem like stuff I could make at home with a can of Ragu and a box of Barilla. Nevertheless, I definitely eat my money's worth when I'm there for the Never Ending Pasta Bowls (it's only $10!). Over the years, they've expanded their selections for the promotion, now featuring at least 6 sauces and 8 pastas that you can mix and match. You can certainly try other stuff on their menu: I've always liked their capellini pomodoro and eggplant parm, and I would occasionally get their seafood dishes, but for the price, you might as well go to a ""real"" Italian restaurant. Service also varies at this location. The place is big (2 floors but is mapped like a fricking maze) and of course is always packed, and therefore more often than not, your waiter is running around with half his head cut off (figuratively, of course). If you want to catch his attention, better always be on the lookout and wave frantically when you see him peek his head around the corner for a split second. Overall, it's okay to stop by once in a while, but get your fine dining on elsewhere.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Can't beat the view of Times Square for a seat that does not necessarily require reservations. The waitstaff is constantly turning over, so don't look for anyone there to develop a rapport with for any advantage in seating or deals.  The service is therefore hit and miss with the inconsistency of staff.  I frankly have not experienced a service foul up here, but have witnessed it from tables around me.  Everything from wrong dishes being brought to customers to missing credit cards. This particular Olive Garden's pastas are marginally better than most Olive Garden branches, where the pastas actually resemble pasta and not overcooked mush.  The tossed salad is not fresh, but I'm not here for the greens.  The bread sticks are fluffy, but also less buttery and more baking soda than they use to be. The Seafood Portofino and other such pastas come from a frozen premixed package, so buyer beware for those with food allergies or think they are buying fresh products.  If you have a food allergy, they can pick out individual items from the mix, but they've been mingling and mixing in there since they left the processing plant. This Olive Garden is one of the best in the chain, but still does not hold a candle to actual Italian specialty dining.",3.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Friends don't let friends eat at Olive Garden.

Tonight I had a bellini, shrimp garlic scampi and a little chocolate cream desert which was laughably small but only $4. The salad was very good, the breadsticks a little too oily and salty, the shrimp garlic tasted like Weight Watchers and the desert was average. Another person had the tiramisu and that was great. The Bellini was memorable and so was the margarita. The prices are kind of insane for what you get, but one tip -- sign up for their eClub online and you get a desert or app free with two entries.

Which is why I don't get why people want to come here.  Their pastas are no better than a box of dry spaghetti and Ragu that cost $3.  The place is crowded and the wait can be long and some tourists are amazingly patient with the poor service here. Lastly rule #1, don't eat at any establishment within 2 block radius of Times Square.",1.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I thought, Ok..I'm in the middle of Times Square it's dinner time and there are people everywhere. The wait is going to be insane! So, we walk in and get seated right away, waitress greets us brings me a few samples of wine, brings out the appetizers and 10 mins later our food arrives. I ordered the Seafood Brodetto with Scallops, shrimp, tilapia with spinach and mushrooms simmered in a light white wine and marinara-saffron broth. Served with toasted ciabatta bread. The serving portion was quite small but very tasty! I walked out of here pleased and impressed that yes it was an Olive Garden restaurant in the middle of Time Square!",4.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I don't get all the bad reviews, of course the wait will be long, it's one of TWO locations in all of Manhattan! OF COURSE the food isn't real Italian it's Olive Garden! You know what you are getting when you go there, and you still went. Shut up! THE drinks, the salad, the bread sticks, the dessert, and the OMG Soup! Is why I go, I don't even want an entree after all that, sometimes I get a server willing to hook me up and let me get away without ordering an entree and just load up on the freebies, I tip well for that because really it's all I came here to eat. Nothing on the menu impresses me. I would take a gallon of the soup home if I could though lol, and the chocolate mousse cake is heavenly. Hubby will eat the steak or chicken parm if he's up to it, we don't go here too often, only when I crave soup. The service and view are great though so they deserve the stars here. I didn't have the added on tip though, this is standard after 8-9pm in NYC area though so I don't get that gripe either. You can request to pay less if you don't like your server, but I have yet to go to a place in the city that does not do this after dark.

"I LOVE IT HERE! I like Olive Garden in general. I haven't had any bad experiences with this restaurant, but this Times Square one in particular has been my favorite. The fact that it's 3 stories high is really cool to me for some reason. We didn't make a reservation and went as a party of 5 at the usual dinnertime so it was packed, as anticipated. However, considering the number of people there that night, it was only about a 30 min wait time for us, which isn't bad at all. We were seated on level three. The customer service was great. Their waiters are kind, respectful and attentive. Their unlimited salad and breadsticks were good as always. I ordered the stuffed chicken marsala, which was delicious, even though I'm not a big fan of mushrooms. I highly recommend it. I also ordered my all-time favorite, raspberry lemonade, which never fails to disappoint. On a random note, they play a lot of good music. I remember listening to a lot of Kanye that night, which I loved. My overall experience here was amazing.",4.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I like the familiar. After eating a lot of exotic food in a lot of restaurants during our time in New York, we decided to go to dinner in Times Square in Olive Garden, reliable old Olive Garden. This was a mistake. We waited for more than a hour in a long line. I was familiar with long waits, especially in the Times Square area - we did eat at other restaurants in Times Square, particularly the Hard Rock Cafe, but again, this was just an Olive Garden and I waited for more than hour, which I thought was outrageous. The menu was overpriced beyond belief. The same things that cost 10$ in other Olive Gardens cost 20$ here. It does not taste better either, the dishes felt barely heated. The service was ok, nothing to brag about. The most outrageous thing I have ever seen - 18% automatic gratuity (for 3). What is the world coming to? Did they not think I would tip well so they automatically debited 18% as service charge? I was offended, highly offended that they are automatically debiting payment for their service without offering me a choice. I was planning on tipping them well but after this shenanigan, I did not feel like offering them a penny more. A great research topic for an enterprising academic: someone should study the effect of automatic tipping on customer service and customer retention. And, they asked for an additional tip...Seriously, after an hour long wait, an additional tip? Do they even respect their customers? 79$ for bad service (1 hour+ wait), overpriced food (highly overpriced) and 18% automatic gratuity (I have never heard of any restaurant having automatic gratuity for small company - especially freaking Olive Garden).

So we gave another $5.00 not realizing the tip was not only ""suggested"" but already  included in the total. It is upsetting to be deceived like this! I'm a native New Yorker and can't believe I fell for this deception! I'm sure they do this all the time and tourist are ripped off all the time.

"Got the bottomless pasta bowl.

Btw, you pick the soup and that's all you get, can't switch it around for your second helping. My biggest complaint was the service. It was so slow...20 minutes every time waitress comes by. She got our second order wrong...we ordered pasta with meatballs and one plate came without any meat, the other came with sausage. Instead of just taking both back like any other way it would have been done at other restaurants, she asked me to put the sausage in a plate for her to bring back and that she will bring us TWO meat balls.

"Went there with my mom when she was visiting me from Ukraine. It was a really awful experience. The waiter was highly unprofessional. First we asked him what specials do they have,what is the dish of the day, and he answered ""everything is special"". When we did our order and was waiting for around 30 min it turned out that he forgot part of our order so we had to wait another 30 min. Every time we were asking him something he was really rude. Then we asked for a manager. When manager came and we explained him situation he said that he will talk to that waiter very seriously. We saw them talking but it was clearly seen that he didn't punish the waiter,cause both of them were laughing. The manager sent us another waiter. At the very end when we were done and paid for our food we asked for a copy of check, but the girl said that she already closed the program so she can't bring us check. We asked for a manager again. When that guy came he was mean and unrespectful, he screamed at us ""for what u need check?u need change?"" After these words he took out 2$ out of his pocket and threw it on our table.

Ok it's just Olive Garden but c'mon I was craving that salad and breadsticks deal for $9!!! Salad was so fresh and honestly nothing upsets me more than when a salad is rotting away and they serve it to you anyway... So when this was nice and fresh I basically ate the entire bowl. The breadsticks where good but I've had way better bread to be honest. What's nice about them is that they're warm and the taste of the garlic salt sprinkled on top of them makes them addicting. But there really is better bread out there. Still good though. I went here with a friend and there was no wait and we were seated immediately and it was at 6:30! But it was also a Wednesday night.

"I mean, just because of the last shard of the New Yorker pride left in me, I can't give it a 5. But, I hang my head in shame because I really had NOTHING to complain about in this restaurant. I mean, even the bathroom was clean and spacious! And the automated water faucet was just the right temperature! Those are always spewing boiling water! I don't know what to think. I really don't know who I am anymore. I successfully avoided this place for 9 years! 9 years! I moved to NYC in 2003. And, ALWAYS scoffed at the GLARING TOURIST DESTINATION until last night. Last night, just for kicks, my fiance and I agreed to go in and really experience it to make a list of complaints that will be obvious to us as NYers. Both of us were doing this JUST to reaffirm our NYer snobbery that any place in Time Square is a blinged-out masquerade of mediocrity: stuff that non-NYers REALLY like. Lo and behold, the wait we were told was 15 minutes. Tuesday night, always crowded location, 15 minutes, not bad. The actual wait was like 7-10 minutes. There goes no complaint. I was pretty sure we'll be ignored by the servers. Nope, in fact the server was really NICE. We even left ADDITIONAL tip along with the 18% gratuity already calculated in our bill. WHAT WAS GOING ON? The breadsticks were warm and tasty. Salad was LARGE and tasty. And the calamari and pizza were ALL enjoyable. Did we have any expectations going in to it? Yes, the expectation that everything will fall short. But, really, everything was enjoyable. AND, the strawberry frozen margaritas were...seriously good. I even tasted the right amount of alcohol in there. And I had a few margaritas in my lifetime. This warm, full belly, really nothing to complain about is giving a serious reevaluation on what NYer standards are. Perhaps, in trying to be a really authentic NYer, I have created a facade for myself without knowing. Maybe being a NYer is not such a esoteric identity. Maybe...I'm not special and I am but a simple human who loves chain restaurants. Whatever it is, this enjoyment came with far more complications of the identity crisis. I'm not sure if I would've rather remained ignorant of how the Olive Garden was really like inside. FYI, I have eaten Italian in Arthur Ave in the Bronx. Like, the one most culturally authentic Italian streets where people actually speak Italian. Bobby Flay lost in a throw down in this 'hood for egg plant parmesan or something. My point is, this place wasn't your tourist hotspot. It's a true NYer's little Italy. So, it's not like we didn't have a basis of comparison in ""authentic Italian restaurants."" But, nevertheless, we both came out satisfied from this TIME SQUARE OLIVE GARDEN. Maybe we were just more easy to please than we thought. Sure, the bill was a bit high. PIzza about $17 Margarita about $8 Calamary $13 And most pasta dishes were $22+ But, these are prices you see anywhere in NYC. Yea, I don't know. I wrote this review to help cope with the shock of enjoying a tourist destination as a NYer. I am still in shock, and my fiance and I are now going to do a tour of Time Square restaurants which is perhaps a desperate seeking of the answer that has been deconstructed by the Olive Garden, ""What does it mean to be a New Yorker?""",4.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

We were seated upstairs and our waiter just took his sweet time stopping at our table. We ordered 6 drinks and he never came back with them, 10 minutes went by and he brought 1 bowl of salad and 8 breadsticks no drinks, another 10 minutes goes by and by now I'm getting edgy as I had medicine to take. He came over with such a very bad attitude and very snotty  demeanor.  He was extremely rude and his facial expressions and attitude was terrible. We finally ordered after 25 mins and never asked us once if we needed refills or if we wanted cheese nothing he basically  ignored us. We were there a good hour and a half we had to ask for our check,  i asked for a to go cup never got that.  We left 50% of each meal.  He told my whole family NOT to order the chicken parm as 3 of us planned to eat that, he said it would be soggy so we all changed our orders.  Im so disappointed.   The manager came over and I  told him everything.  When we left SELFIR our waiter gave each of us the most disgusting look ever. His ass would be fired for sure. I  saw how he spoke to the  customers also. This definitely is not the job for him.  We will never be eating there again. The bill was almost  $200. The bowls were hot the food was luke warm. My lasagna with chicken was ok the best part was the breaded chicken, we should have just ordered that instead.  Waiters should not be telling customers not to order some thing thats wrong.

"I came here because i've only heard good things about Olive Garden, and I figured it was a good time to try it because of their 2 for $25 deal. I'm probably never coming here again. The wait time was terrible. I was ready to walk out and eat somewhere else once I heard that I had to wait 45 minutes to get a table on a weekday. I guess it somewhat makes sense since this is in the middle of Times Square where it is filled with tourists, but they should've seriously expected to have more customers then they currently have room for. There were no seats for waiting since the place was packed, so my friends and I ended up sitting on the floor next to a smelly bathroom to wait. When we were finally seated, I was surprised to find out that the 2 for $25 wasn't even mentioned anywhere. Instead, we saw a 2 for $38 menu which I was a bit perplexed about, and it wasn't a very nice surprise. I had the Sicilian Seafood Lasagna Rollata for my entree, and the Calamari and Bruschetta for our appetizer. I also tried three soups (why not, it's unlimited), which were the Zuppa Toscana, Pasta e Fagioli, and the Chicken Gnocchi. The chicken one was my favorite. The breadsticks also went really well with the soup, we had three baskets of those (again, why not. I sneaked some into my bag). I'm not going to write much about the food since it's a franchise, and it's expected that they serve good food at a certain standard. The food pretty much lived up to that standard. The ambiance of the place was meh. I was quite disappointed walking into here because I expected it to be a bit more classy and better kept. It looked nothing like what it seemed to be on their commercials. Overall, if I ever wanted to go to Olive Garden ever again, I would go to one where it wasn't in the middle of a tourist destination. A helpful tip to those who live in NY - don't come here unless you're in the mood for your nerves to get racked up by tourists. A tip to tourists - unless you're from a country where they don't have Olive Gardens, FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO EAT! You're in New York to experience new things, so you should also go to restaurants that you can't find where you live.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"We knew that prices are inflated but this location is more accessible by train (there was so much snow that day). Liked the breadsticks and salad.  We chose the pick 2 appetizers bec. that was the only way to get cheese triangles for the kids.  There was very little calamari that they looked like leftovers on the plate. Was only really satisfied with shrimp vesuvio with bucatini pasta which was spicy and satisfying.  The 2 Pasta dishes with cream sauce we had tasted very heavy on the cream and butter. Big downside:  We didn't appreciate that the waiter most likely noted the additional generous tip we mistakenly added but didn't tell us.  We had gift cards so the waiter actually showed us 3 different versions of the bill - one was original, 2nd reflected the gift card, 3rd was the one to sign.  Bec. of this, we were getting confused with the tip amount and actually forgot the tip was already included.  Good thing we were still in the Times Square area when I started thinking about it so we went back.  A manager was nice enough to correct the error but couldn't give a receipt that reflected it.  My husband had to check his account.",1.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I enjoyed my visit to the Olive Garden. As a resident of NYC I try to avoid anything in Times Square due to the overcrowding and chaos in that area.  Because I happened to be stuck in Times Sq waiting for someone, I decided to grab a bite at Olive Garden. I was dreading the visit, but it turned out to be not as bad as I expected!  The wait was short, I was seated and greeted promptly, customer service was excellent by my waiter and the door greeter, the food was brought out quickly and hot. I surprisingly enjoyed myself there.  If I had a guest from out of town that wanted to eat there, I wouldn't mind it.",5.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
18% service charge for a party of 2! They should tell you tip is included. Unsuspecting customers who trust a bug chain are being ripped off by unknowingly tipping 38%.

"I'm not going to make snarky comments about tourists, since most of the diners appeared to be locals. It turns out that lots of people want a predictable Italian-ish experience after braving the Theater District, and who am I to say they can't have it? However. The food is subpar by any standard, even if you're cool with Italian-American, fried-everything, and overly salted food. Even that would be bearable if it were cheap, but it's not. In fact, it seems like screwing the customer is the game plan here. Everything is significantly more expensive than the same items at other OG locations. Worst of all, they tack an 18% tip on the bill automatically--and then have the chutzpah to put an ""additional tip"" line on the receipt. Uh, no. You can have one or the other, but not both. That's too bad because we all thought the service was friendly and professional. Quite the surprise, and the only quality thing about this whole place.",2.0,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This place made me want to punch myself in the face. Mostly because that would be the only way to get my anger out without getting arrested. What went so wrong? LET ME JUST TELL YOU. 1) Waiting around for staff who are all just puttering around on their cell phones. 2) Being led to a table by a hostess who wouldn't speak to us, look in our direction, or even let us know that it was our group who should be following her to the table. 3) A waitress who walked up staring at her order pad, pen in hand, refusing to look up or say any words at all. 4) A replacement server halfway through with no explanation or grasp on what we had already ordered. 5) Drinks arriving about eight minutes apart. 6) An appetizer that simply was not fit to be eaten. To be fair, my pasta was fine. Nothing exciting, but nothing compared to the other issues of the visit.

My friend and me would come here once in the blue. We would get 1 entree and share because it's pretty filling. There is also unlimited salads and bread sticks! They are both soo good. I would come back here just for the salad and bread if I can. We never get to finish our food if we both have a entree. They don't give us a different look when we share one either so this is good. And they will split it up to two dishes in the kitchen which is a huge plus! It's always the off peak times when I dine in here so I never had a problem on waiting for a table or having them give me a check without asking for it. The seats are spacey and comfortable. They always give me the booth tables. The tables are far from each other so I don't hear other peoples conversations nor can they hear mines.

Attended this restaurant for lunch with my husband. Parking was available. As we were seated we were asked if near the fireplace was ok. The seating was perfect because it was chilly outside so the fireplace gave me extra warmth. It also added a touch of romance to our lunch date. The waitress was extremely friendly and on point with meals and suggestions. She didn't write our choices down and yet managed to get it all right. She cane over enough times to check up on us.

"Who doesn't love OG once in a blue moon? Forget that NYC and NJ has some of the BEST Italian restos ever known to man, BUT do they have unlimited breadsticks, soup and salad? I think not. We hardly eat at chains and it had been about 5 or 6 years since we've last eaten at an OG but my body was craving it. Finally The Husband was sick of hearing me talk about it day and night so he took me to the nearest one we could find-- not Times Square-- and against his will, he was subjected to basic pasta. We went around 3:45p cause we didn't want to do that hour waiting battle with the dinner crowd. Also, it was still at that cutoff where we wouldn't need to eat dinner cause we were bout to gorge! Surprised to find, it was jam packed! I mean, was the never ending pasta special going on or something? Yes, yes it was. Anyhoo, told it was about a 30 min wait but we were seated about 15 mins later. Started with the stuffed mushrooms cause that's what I always get as an app. Would you know, I think I'm over it. It was pretty tasteless, yes I know, what did I expect? Finally to the zuppa toscana soup (Italian sausage w/ kale) mmmm ordered two bowls. Parmesan? Oh yes please. Baskets of breadsticks, that garlicky top part is really all I want! And yum yum salad. By the time my Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo came, I was stuffed and we had to bring it home. It lasted us quite a few lunches...Score! The Husband got the Chicken & Shrimp carbonara and though the chicken was mushy, his dish was pretty flavorful. Clocking in at a 1580 cals, he split his into three lunch portions as well. All in all, hit the spot. Service was pretty terrific despite the crowd. You gotta give it to those OG waiters to deal with the unlimited never ending pasta folks. So tip well and don't be a huge PITA. After having the pasta sweats, we rolled ourselves out of there. Been coming here on/off since high school so I hope you always stay the same, never change.

"2/25/18 My family and I went out to celebrate my oldest sons birthday. He wanted to have his birthday dinner at Olive Garden so we visited this location because we have visited on numerous occasions. We called ahead and made reservations so our wait time was nothing when we arrived we were seated immediately our server was very friendly we placed our orders and while waiting for our food to be prepared our bread and salad was brought out to us. We ALL served ourselves salad we ALL ate our salads. ""I"" on the other hand started to get a nasty taste in my mouth and felt something slimy! I spit it out onto my plate and I was immediately sick to my stomach!!!!! I just had some type of larva in my mouth!!!! My entire family ate the salad that lava had been decaying in!!!!! Talk about losing your appetite!!!!! Our server returned to our table with our appetizers, and that's when I showed her what I literally had in my mouth and almost ingested! She was mortified and took the plate from me immediately and said that she was going to show the manager. She asked if we still wanted the appetizers I told her that we honestly did not feel like we wanted to stay. She apologized repeatedly and said that she would send the manager. The manager came to the table, she said that she was ""so sorry"" (she didn't really look like she cared nor like she wanted to be bothered) and that ""she doesn't know how it happened"" we explained that we were going to leave and she basically begged us to stay and that she would ""compensate"" us for our awful experience...... My Family and I discussed it and took her up on her offer, because she assured us that she was going to do right by us, and we thought about the chances of us finding another restaurant in the area that we could just walk into and be seated immediately were going to be very slim! So we stayed.....  The manager said that she would return to check on us while we dined, (SHE NEVER RETURNED!) our server was very friendly, very accommodating throughout our stay and she told me that the managers said ""not to even bother bringing us the bill,"" so we were all under the impression that she was compensating the entire bill, especially since we ALL ATE OUT OF THAT SALAD BOWL!!!! I was just the one that hit the larva jackpot! God only knows if we did ingest any larva!!!!  Long story short, we didnt even touch our food because we had ALL lost our appetite, So we asked our server to bring us some  containers so that we can take the food to go because we weren't hungry AT ALL after that's nauseating experience!!!! She happily obliged, they sang happy birthday to my son. A few minutes later our server shamefully came to the table with our bill and said ""I'm so sorry, but this is all she was willing to compensate"" The manager ONLY Compensated my entrée and appetizer!!!! As if I was the ONLY person that was affected by what happened!!!!! My entire family ate that salad we mix the salad up before serving ourselves therefor our little decaying larva friend came in contact with every spoon we put into her mouths!!!!!! I will never return to this Olive Garden again!!!! The food we paid for went STRAIGHT to the trash!!!! We didn't even touch it when we arrived home! We were still very disgusted with what happened to US, AND how it was handled! Never again!!!!!",1.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Bread is so soft and tasty. We ordered 2 entrees- pork and beef jambalaya and chicken with zucchini. Both entrees comes with chicken soup and caesar salad respectively.

"Average. Just average and that's really all there is to it. The prices seemed to have bumped up, this place isn't worth more than $12 an entree and I'm stretching the amount only because the quantity they give u is more than enough. Breadsticks aren't what they used to be, stale, dry and had to wait 30 minutes for it to reach my table. Salad is still the same, probably the best thing there. If you choose to sit at the bar during the cold weather, you will feel the cold every time that door opens which is OFTEN. Ladies up front do a great job trying to seat people quickly, and are very friendly. I suggest you make a reserv before coming, it gets packed. (2hr advance required). The food isn't the worst, but there are much better places to go. PS**** Save money and build your own pasta. For the same meal and the same portion you save MUCH more money than ordering your pasta as an entree. EXAMPLE: chicken Alfredo entree was 18$ .

Average chain restaurant but the plus side is that you get either a free salad or some to go with your entree so if you're hungry or a big guy like myself it's actually worth the 15-16 bucks you'll pay for the meal.

"My boyfriend, his mom, and I ended up here for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday (I don't clearly remember) because we didn't seem to know where else to eat and plus the boyfriend loves their unlimited bread sticks and salad. I've been to two Olive Gardens before and we don't typically eat at restaurants like Olive Garden, so I wasn't expecting outstanding service or experience, but the service here was on point. The decor felt very Italian-like, homey, and family friendly. We were seated at a booth and I was surprised to see a tablet where you can place certain orders from, pay for your bill, play games, and much more. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The bread sticks were baked just right and didn't have an overwhelming garlic taste which I liked. The house salad was okay and has a bit of tartness. My boyfriend also had a soup: chicken and gnocchi soup which was very creamy and delicious. We also ordered a sampler as an appetizer (mistake, since we were super full from the salad, bread sticks, and entrees). We got the fried calamari and fried mozzarella and they both came with a marinara sauce and tartar sauce, for $9.99. The fried calamari was good, but I wasn't a fan of the fried mozzarella - smelled and tasted extremely cheesy which I didn't like too much. My boyfriend decided on this special where you can order three dishes for one price so he ordered: Rigatoni with five cheese marinara sauce, stuffed chicken Marsala with mushrooms ravioli, and chicken parmigiana. His dish definitely looked very filling and tasty. The stuffed chicken Marsala with mushrooms was okay, a little dry and definitely needed more sauce. I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and it looked really good, super filling and creamy. Unfortunately I wasn't too happy with the shrimp because they used the mini shrimps you would find in a fried rice and this dish was: $16.79, not really worth it. I can definitely make the dish at home a lot cheaper and nicer. My boyfriend's mom ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana which came with a side of spaghetti and tomato sauce. It was a filling dish for her and the eggplant Parmigiana was well made. Overall, the experience here was definitely a lot better than the other two Olive Gardens I've been to in the city. Service is definitely 5 times better. It's nice to see they are also getting more technologically advanced with the tablets. Food can use just a tiny it of work.

My husband and brother ordered a beer at the bar which was paid for and then my husband requested another beer, which he forgot(never brought out). He came back to the table and repeated the order again and said just to make sure he gets it right. Food came out all over the place. 3 of us ordered the endless soup and salad (our salad did not have banana peppers) Server mentioned they were out. My niece asked for a refill on her raspberry lemonade but he indicated they ran out. So, she only go that one glass and then asked for water. We 3 requested more soup. He brought our 3 bowls half full saying that they ran out and were making more. Oh my gosh at this time I was so frustrated never have had this happen at an Olive Garden. Not a pleasant experience! Don't recommend eating here!! To top is off we asked for the check to pay and he did not separate the check out!!!

"I went to Olive Garden for lunch today with my husband because of their $5 unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks promotion. We were seated immediately and directed to a 2-person booth in the main dining area. Our server was Jaime, and he introduced us to a woman whom he was training (can't remember her name unfortunately). Jaime was polite, attentive and offered us very good service! He set an excellent example to the woman he was helping to train. However, my compliments to the service we experienced pretty much ends there. The manager came to our table twice to check in on us. The first time, she commented on the artichoke fritti appetizer and told us that that was her favorite app on menu. The second time she came by, she pointed out that my husband left two pieces of tortellini on his plate. She went on to say that she was Hispanic but never explained the connection. She also pointed out that I left the best part of the soup behind - the gnocchi. We felt like we were with our mothers who were criticizing us for wasting food. It was just strange and very unwelcome! Then, during our entire meal, we couldn't help but notice the server who was handling the tables next to us. She was friendly and attentive but she insisted on calling everyone ""baby"" or ""my love."" It seemed overly familiar and very inappropriate to us. She threw these terms of endearment into every other sentence like, ""Do you need anything else my love? A refill? Sure, I'll get that for you baby."" I wouldn't have minded if she was my 80 year-old grandmother, but if she was my server, I would have asked her to stop. As mentioned, I ordered the soup, salad and breadsticks. The salad was delicious. Slightly overdressed for my liking but nothing terrible. We received two batches of breadsticks, but both were on the saltier side. Not unedible, but definitely salty. Also, the first basket of bread sticks was maybe a minute or two under cooked, and the second basket was just right. I ordered 2 different kinds of soup - pasta e fagioli and chicken and gnocchi. The pasta e fagioli was delicious! However, the chicken and gnocchi was so-so. I left the gnocchi behind because they were terrible. They're supposed to be pillows of potato that virtually melt in your mouth. These were just glue-y chewy dumplings. Along with this, I ordered the artichoke fritti which came with a creamy lemon dip. The sauce was ok but I honestly think if they squeezed a little fresh lemon on top, it would have been absolutely delicious on it's own. The dip was overpowering. My husband ordered the tour of Northern Italy, which came with cheese tortellini and meat sauce, chicken Lombardi, and fettuccine with mushrooms in a cream sauce. Again, everything was salty but not to the point where it was unedible. Also, the chicken Lombardi was not undercooked but it could have used another two minutes to get it browned a little bit more.  Overall, everything was fine but just not truly satisfying. The restaurant is well-maintained, clean, and airy. We received our food in a prompt manner and everything was hot and looked well-prepared. However, there are so many options for good Italian food in Northern NJ. There's almost no reason to go to Olive Garden unless there's some sort of special promotion going on. Even then, there's one or two other Italian chain restaurants in the nearby vicinity that offers much better Italian food for similar prices with better service. We had not been to an Olive Garden in quite some time and now we remember why.",2.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Olive Garden has great service and people. The waiters don't make you wait long. They ask you how many people you have, and in an instant, they guide you to your table. When you get there, they give you a menu and they wait until you are finished. They're very polite and it doesn't matter how long you take because they're always ready to assist. Once you've told them your order, they bring your food really fast. They always ask if you want parmesan and if you do, they grate parmesan right on top of your plate. If you want a place that has great service, you should go to Olive Garden. Olive Garden has some of the best food you can get. They mostly serve pasta, but it's amazing. The food comes warm and you straight away. Most restaurants have great pictures of food on their menus that don't look like the food you're going to get. On the other hand, Olive Garden has the exact pictures of food you are going to get. All in all, Olive Garden is one appetizing place. At olive Garden, they have a very fancy place. Their tables are long and short. When you look around you can see chandeliers and paintings. Their floors and spot less and it smells nice and fresh when you walk in. If you're more of an outdoor person, they have a whole outdoor section. Outside, they have an umbrella in the middle of the table in case it starts to rain.

Service is great, sometimes waiters do take a little long to come back to the table specially when you get a soup and want another refill before your food arrives. Other than that, they are great! The food is always amazing, never had a complain. I would totally recommend joining their rewards programs since they do send you great deals.

"Needed lunch while on the road and this Olive Garden conveniently located on Route 3 fit the bill. Staff seemed spread a bit thinner as the lunch hour got busier, but they were consistently friendly. Perhaps not coincidentally this was the first time in our many meals at a dozen different outlets of this chain that someone who was apparently a manager (although she didn't introduce herself) not only circulated around the dining room, but actually stopped by each table to check-in on how the meal was going. Right now (March 2016) they're again running their ""buy one take one"" (home) special, so for the price of one bowl of pasta you get two (of your choice), one of which is prepackaged to go.

"Came here to grab some lunch with my wife.  Your typical olive garden decor.  Busy because located in a mall We started by ordering some drinks. My wife had the peach rasberry iced tea and I had the orange cranberry limonata.  The iced tea tasted a little off and different from what my wife can remember and my limonata had a bug in it.  Took forever to flag down my server and when I did she was unapologetic about it.  We had their new artichoke fritti to start.  Looked oily and tasted oily. The sauce didn't really pair too well with it.  The appetizer was actually unappetizing.  We also tried their northern tour of italy.  The breaded chicken was way too salty. The fettuccine was good, as was the tortelloni. Don't really like this location because of the service and quality of the food.  Everything just seemed a little off.",1.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"So it was my birthday a couple of days ago- Yay me.- But what a disappointing way to spend the night at this horrible place. Let's start with the pros. 1. Server was extremely nice. 2. Free Dessert Now, the cons. 1. The wait time for the food was around 50 minutes to an hour. Oh, and before that the wait time for the server to get to us was about 20 minutes. So, yeah, too much time. 2. The food was just disgusting. The baby shrimp were not even cooked and the pasta looked like they just microwaved it. They literally stole $18.00 away from me. 3. I ended up getting sick and vomiting the same night of and two days after that. And, no, it was nothing else. All I ate was a waffle before that and Eggo's had better service than this garbage. 4. I don't even know if what I ate were considered to be garlic bread sticks. It resembled a piece of cardboard with a sprinkle of oregano and tasted like, well you know... 5. I requested a refill and the server ended up taking my beverage- which still had a sufficient amount of sprite in it- and did not return until after I was almost done with the food. Seriously, there was no more food to enjoy with the sprite, WHY EVEN TAKE MY OLD ONE? Just get another glass and when you come back take the old one. Overall, don't come here with your nice shirt and expensive tie because olive garden ain't what it used to be, at least not at this location. Go toast up some eggos with some syrup and you will be better off with more money in your pocket.",1.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Okay - so the highlight of the meal was the Potato Gnocchi soup.  We came to try the Buy One Take One pasta special and it was packed at 9 pm on a Friday night.  Our server was great and very attentive - making sure to keep our salad bowl and water glasses filled. Some dishes we tried: 1. Stuffed sausage rigatoni: Very meh and bland, flat sauce.  It was edible.  Period. 2. Chicken Broccoli Bake: This was actually decent with cavatappi, chicken, broccoli, and alfredo baked with a pastry cover.  Open it up and ask for shredded cheese when it is served. 3. Stuffed mushrooms: Salty and you get 5 TINY mushrooms.  Not a fan. 4. Calamari: Okay but nothing special. 5. Risotto Balls: Very dense and chewy, and just lacking flavor.  Not a fan. 6. Potato Gnocchi soup: Very solid with creamy base, plenty of chicken, and gnocchi, accented with carrots and spinach.  Def. recommend. 7. Minestrone: Very salty and bland.  Not a fan. 8. Sausage Toscani soup: I would rank this behind the Potato Gnocchi.  It was decent with a creamy base but a bit on the watery and salty side. 9. 5 Cheese Ziti: Bland sauce and very sparse on cheese.  I can probably make a better version with Bertolli, cheese, and pasta at home. 10. Breadsticks: Aaah the ""famous"" breadsticks.  Yeah...it's basically a hot dog roll glazed with oil and too much garlic salt.  If you bring one home and reheat, it turns magically hard.  Now doesn't that sound like something you want endless portions of?  It's a good strategy for keeping COGS down with an ""endless"" option...

As soon as you walk in the door of the restaurant smells like aged Parmesan cheese and a dirty dish rags. The smell permeates the entire restaurant.

So I waited in the waiting area and witnessed staff just fooling around. One was throwing lemon wedges at another, landing on the floor and multiple staff walked by without cleaning. This is a safety issue as it can cause people to slip and fall on the hard floor! Additionally, by the entrance a group of 5-6 staff were just hanging out just ignoring customers. By the pickup area, 2 employees were just chilling and offered no assistance when I walked up to ask about when my order would be ready. One ignored me and the other said it's only been 7 min, when in reality I've already waited 20 min so I proceeded to wait in front of them and some staff were getting impatient and kept telling me it's coming. Finally I received my order around 5:05 PM, after waiting 30 min!. I also asked for bowls in my order but they said they did not have any. This is by far the worst customer experience ever.",1.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"My gf and I came into this restaurant on 4/7/14 about 1/2 before ""closing"" or in reality, when no more tables are to be seated. The waiter seemed annoyed to serve us as well as another couple that came in around the same time. Noticing our surroundings once seated, we observed that staff members were sweeping and using chemicals to clean, while there were still customers in the dining room, eating! Also, our waiter left a large tray of dirty dishes on the table next to ours, where it remained for the rest of our time there. We ordered non-alcoholic drinks, an appetizer and an entrée..... Service started normally. We got our drinks quickly. Well, olive garden is known for providing salad and breadsticks. Our appetizer came- no salad or breadsticks. The waiter stated that ""he forgot"". After another 20 minutes, the salad and breadsticks arrive. The salad had no dressing and at least an entire bag of croutons, crumbs and all. Immediately after, our entrees arrived. That's when things turned south! My carbonara was greasy, the chicken was dry, overcooked and rubbery. My gf's ravioli was cold and the sauce tasted old. From this point forward, the waiter vanished and was not to be seen again. I had to get up, go to the servers station and get the grated cheese- I grated the cheese for us and the other couple that had arrived with us. Both tables needed their drinks refreshed... This never happened. My gf needed the leftovers from her entrée to be wrapped... This never happened either. After another 15 min, still with no waiter in sight, we got up to leave. I passed the greeter's station where I demanded to speak to the manager. The waiter bursts out of the door asking other staff members if they ""saw the people that were at his table"". There we stood, in plain sight- he didn't even recognize us! I spoke to the manager, who looked to young to actually be the manager (the situation was suspicious). He provided a comp for our appetizer and swore up and down that it was his fault as he had called the server into his office but that the server never mentioned that he had tables! We will never, ever go to any Olive Garden again! Every time we dine at an Olive Garden  (Brooklyn/Starrett City; Garden City, LI; Times Sq.), we are exposed to the same levels of despicable service quality. To top it off, I'm Italian and despise its ""wannabe"" Italian food to begin with! (My gf loves it even though I've exposed her to ""real"" Italian food.) We also understand that it is a theme restaurant, or a step above fast food, but we NEVER received such poor service from any of the competing restaurants in the surrounding area!",1.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"OK, I love Yelp and 90% I tend to agree with the average Yelp opinion but in this case I must go against the grain.  The reviews here are way too negatively extreme. My experiences here with my girlfriend have been great.  The bread sticks come out hot and flavorful, the salad is fresh, huge, and filling, and the main courses are hot and tasty as well. Best of all - they run lots of promotions which are great values like the never ending pasta bowls or the buy one take one entree home, which were the last two promotions I happened to catch here. Lets just say I ate 5 bowls of pasta, broke that waitresses all time record pasta bowls served in one night, and left EXTREMELY satisfied during the never ending pasta promotion! Buy one take one is also a great promotion you can't beat and includes some of the favorite pasta and meat dishes on the menu. Also, c'mon how can you beat always unlimited salad and breadsticks?  Where else do you get that?  Sue me. I'm just going to take one star off for the wait time which can be 20-40 mins on a Saturday night.  They are somewhat a victim of their own success in that regard since it is so busy but I feel like they could open another location, or just run a little more efficiently if you are getting these crowds.",4.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I rarely, and I mean rarely, dine at chain restaurants; if I am looking for an affordable meal, I would prefer a cozy, local ethnic spot.  However, when I am eating with others in New Jersey, I am often limited to dining where they feel comfortable, like at Olive Garden.  Sure there are worse franchises, but any place where I am stuck waiting in a parking lot holding a beeper, does not usually warrant the accompanying hassle.  This particular Olive Garden location was fine in terms of service and food, but still nothing to praise. Our meal began with their warm, doughy, and artificial Bread Sticks. They were delightful in that bad for you sense.  A large bowl of their signature Salad began with limp iceberg lettuce and was topped with the usual, and non-fresh I might add, carrot and red cabbage strands.  However, they did allow us to add black olives and tomatoes into our mix, which was a positive change.  The Minestrone Soup was heavily over-seasoned with robust herbs, leaving my mouth tasting as if it had a garden growing inside of it. When it came to my entree, I decided to go with one of the healthier options, the Venetian Apricot Chicken.  While this did not seem overly Italian, I wanted to pick something light.  The grilled chicken breasts were actually pretty moist, and the sweet glaze was delightful, though much more Asian-style than anything else.  The side blend of steamed broccoli, asparagus and diced tomatoes was cooked perfectly. My meal at Olive Garden sure had its low points, but it was not all bad.  If I absolutely had to dine at a national chain, this would certainly not be my last choice.",2.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

For the most part this place is good. Although because the area in general is mostly Hispanic our waitress had. Hard time getting exactly what I wanted.

"Like almost every other Olive Garden, the food is pretty decent for a national chain restaurant.  I'm sure it's not very healthy unless you stick with just the salad - if you finish your meal, you'll probably feel a little heavy, uneasy inside. For this particular location, I've come here several times over the course of many years.  The restaurant looks clean and most tables are occupied - it's popular in the area so expect to wait if you come during peak hours.  The only thing that puzzled me was the service.  Despite having many workers, service has always been lacking here.  I've once waited 10 minutes to order my drinks, only to wait another 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive and be able to order my food.  On the most recent visit, I waited 10 minutes for the check, in addition to the 15 minutes to place my order.  The best service I've had was at the bar.  They were prompt with the drinks and taking your food order. If service wasn't so iffy, I would probably rate Olive Garden higher.  They have good deals now and then, with some specials that will let you stuff your face if you so desire (ie. never-ending pasta bowl).",3.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Our server was really great, the place was super clean...but they should get a handle on the staff loitering by the POS system by the kitchen door.  They were quite loud and obnoxious, and acting like a bunch of ""r-words"" (refer to Gaga's gaffe in the papers for the meaning there).",3.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"It's cheap. They don't take reservations so it sucks when you have to wait to get seated for sub par food. I don;t understand how this place gets packed also. The only thing that's good is that it is cheap. I've been here a couple times and either when it's busy or it's a slow day the waiters are not the best in the biz. It'll take you around 10 minutes to get a refill of water. Once you order your food next time they see you is for the free bread and salad. Sometimes it won't even be the same waiter who asked for your order in the first place. The free garlic bread is okay. There's really no garlic on it though at least they serve it hot. The salad is better than the bread. They give you croutons, peppers, olives, onions, all mixed in with the greens in oil and vinegar. Fried calamari is decent. I've had worse and it's a good size portion. There wasn't anything special about them. The lemon was needed. I've also had their four cheese spaghetti which was not bad to say the least. It wasn't the best but it definitely filled me up. I've also had their five cheese ziti which was also a huge portion for one person. I think it's better to share an entree and save on the cost. I wish though they asked if you want fresh Parmesan on top or fresh salt and pepper to make this place more fancier. But it doesn't. You get your food, eat your food, and take the left overs home.

They were really nice but they were swamped and tired. They did their best in keeping us happy. They busted thier ass at every table. We orders the sampler appetizer with fried calamar, stuff mushroom and fried ravioli. We got salad because we didn't get the option for soup. I had the short rib with some ravioli thingy as my entree. For dessert our waitress brought all 5 of the ""dessert shot"". Overall, it was good.

"So, Olive Garden.... Not a single positive thought comes to mind about this place. First of all, you walk in and it smells like dirty mop water and children's vomit. Not too appetizing.  Then of course there's a 30 minute wait to be seated, so please have a seat on the leather couch while the family who is also waiting next to you lets their 3 year old climb all over you. But of course, after one ordeal comes another...ordering the damn dinner you had originally trekked all the way here for. Our waiter was completely incompetent, and found it more of a priority to try to flirt with me and my friend then to ask us what we wanted to order. However, after another 5 minutes of shamelessness, he finally asked us for our order. Being a cheese lover, I eyeballed the smoked mozzarella fonduta, and my friend went for the fettuccine alfredo. 30 minutes later..Rico Suave returned, plates in hand. My ""smoked"" mozzarella should have been renamed ""burnt mozzarella"", and effectively so I completely lost my appetite. As my friend finished up her order, I decided to give the dessert menu a shot. I mean, c'mon, you can't really miss with dessert, right?

As much as I love Olive Garden's breadsticks - it was not enough to raise a star on this review. I went with my family for an end of the week dinner and we had to wait about 40 minutes for a table. There's not much to say but that the servers didn't really have any idea of what was going on. When we each placed our orders - the server didn't tell us whether or not we would get a salad/soup option or that it would be unlimited. We were never offered extra breadsticks. The food was okay - nothing to brag about. I ordered the chicken marsala and thankfully it was passable. We didn't stay for dessert as it took forever for our food to arrive.

"You obviously don't go to Olive Garden expecting a 5-star dining experience, but for the most part I always like to throw in the occasional OG visit into my routine. They have good food, generous portions and a family-friendly atmosphere. That being said, this location in Secaucus is consistently a bad experience over and over again. In the handful of times I've been here, I've experienced waits that are insanely long, despite there being many visible open tables, incompetent wait staff that screw up your orders and forget to bring your food, or they bring you the wrong meal. My last visit, some child opened the emergency exit and a piercing alarm went off for about three minutes before anyone on staff went over to turn it off. I'm not going to knock the overall chain because for the most part, if you go in expecting decently priced and decent tasting Italian food in a family-friendly atmosphere, OG is fine, I'm just saying that if you're considering THIS location, you're better off looking elsewhere.",2.0,"500 State Rt 3, Secaucus, NJ 07094",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

The food was extra extra average as compared to other olive gardens.  After that the staff started cleaning the restaurant and forgot to bring the check. So we were left there unattended. Finally we got our check and when I requested that I deserved some compensation because of poor service and the horrible food adulterated with house fly n hair, the response was rude. I thought I would have better called a health department at the time when I found the fly n hair in my food. Had terrible experience and would suggest to no one.

"I have been here on numerous occasions over the years. It is good Italian food for a chain restaurant. it is also crowded at times, which may require you to wait for up to 30 plus minutes to be seated. (You are presented with a eletronic pager device which flashes, beeps, and also vibrates, when a table is available to seat your party.) This Olive Garden is located inside of a strip mall close to a kohl's and off Route 3 West. The staff is attentive and always polite, friendly. I have been to other Olive Garden's restaurants where I waited over one hour to be seated, luckily here about ten to fifteen minutes is all I have waited before. The menus have a good selection, although the prices may be a little high on entrees and some appetizers. No complaints here, other than my son ordered linguine with marinara and received a different sauce once or twice before, however our waiter immediately corrected the mistake with the kitchen and my son still enjoyed his entree. The menu has changed before, although it is fine for my son and I as have the chicken parm and he orders pasta with marinara sauce. Salad looks, and has a good taste as does their croutons. I have been here along with other family members who enjoy eating at Olive Garden once and awhile. The garlic breadsticks are addictive. Go through at least two baskets when I am there. It's free besides if you were not aware. The service is not slow or bad at all, a welcoming atmosphere, and decent decor. I order coffee/cappaccuino for dessert and my son orders cappuccino with ice cream. We both have nothing negative to say towards dessert, Other than it might be a little pricey for certain desserts.

"Horrible food. But this has to be one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been in. I was watching waiters crawling under tables and overturning chairs in the  dining room looking for gum. They dusted everything and vacuumed the whole place. Just wish they took as much pride in the food as they did in keeping the place clean. For being an ""Italian Restaurant"", I daresay I saw anyone that looked even remotely Italian in the place. Real Italians know this food is crap while all the other customers are being bamboozled into thinking this is what real Italian food is. Against my better judgement, I opted to try the special of a piece of lasagne, chicken cutlet parmigiana, and a fettucine alfredo for $16.95. Ugh. The puny hunk of lasagna was actually sweet and unedible, the chicken cutlet looked like a cheap diner reject, and the fettucine was a mound of overcooked noodles with  ladle of heavy cream poured on top. My friend had the  best idea of unlimited salad and soup for $5.95. On our way outside a tourist couple from China asked we take their picture to show they ate at the famous Olive Garden.

"I wanted to love this place, really I did. However, although the server was good and attentive, the customized lasagna was not-so-much. I ordered the grilled chicken alfredo lasagna, same as in the picture I pointed out on the menu. The chicken came out crispy/breaded. The skin on the lasagna came out so burnt/crispy it was all but inedible and made it nearly impossible to cut through without the lasagna falling apart. I needed a knife to cut my food, which for some reason wasn't readily available and I had to wait a while to ask the server for one. She gladly brought it to me, but I still think it shouldn't even have been a ""thing."" The alfredo sauce was, as always, what made the dish. Would I return here? Certainly, if I'm ever in the mood for chain-style Italian-inspired food over the real deal. The endless garlicky breadsticks and salad pretty much help cinch this restaurant for me as a place to indulge in an occasional guilty pleasure.",3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I had a very bad experience at Olive Garden today. We walked in and were told there would be a 10 min wait. That's not a problem, we waited about 5 min and we were seated . We then proceed to ask if there were any kids menus and we were rudely told that there was none without an alternative. So I said, do u mean u don't offer kids items or don't have the menu in stock? She says , they don't have it in stock. Ok whatever , first issue , not a big one but I was a bit annoyed . The server then slowly comes , I should've gotten her name... , super slow service then asks what we want to drink . We told her 4 waters and we'd like to order for the kids first. She told us, order it on the tablet thing they had at the table. She didn't try to tell us what options were avaliable or anything . 2nd thing that annoyed me. So after 15 min, we finally get our 4 waters bare in mind , we haven't ordered any entrees or appetizers or were we asked what we wanted. I even pressed the service button on the tablet and it still took them another 10 min to get to us. So we finally put our entrees and appetizer in. Our entrees, soup and salad all come and i asked , where is our appetizer? If the kitchen forgot to make it, it's fine just take it off the bill. The waitress says, uhhh my coworkers ate ur appetizer. I was dumbfounded. I've never EVER heard of such a thing. She proceeds to tell me that they were hungry and ate our appetizer but the kitchen is working on it now. I just wanted to speak to the manager at this point . The manager comes, he's very nice but I thought he was too young to know how to handle the situation properly. The right thing is to still bring out that appetizer but not charge us or give us 10% off our bill or give us a free dessert but none of that was offered. I had a good experience at the Westbury olive garden last time but honestly I wouldn't come back to this location the next. What type of establishment is it when workers eat a customers food?

"Came tonight (Friday) at 7:30pm. The wait was estimated to be an hour and a half, which was fine. We were a party of 8 and waited at the bar. While waiting, someone at the hostess counter spilled a bottle of wine, which got all over our feet. The glass was everywhere and no one from the staff apologized or cared. The wait was closer to an hour. We got seated by the hostess, but no one came to the table for at least 20 minutes. We had no silverware, water, plates. We finally flag someone down to ask for a waiter and they come to say no one was assigned to our table but they'll wait on our table. We get some salad and breadsticks, with no plates and forks. We wait another ten minutes before a manager comes by with forks. How does a restaurant not have enough forks?? Someone from our party also ordered chicken gnocchi soup, but it took thirty minutes to come out. When our food does come out, half of our dishes are cold and we are still missing a chicken parm. The chicken parm is cold and gets sent back. When it comes out, the pasta is in Alfredo sauce (not what we ordered). I ordered angel hair pasta in creamy mushroom sauce and chicken and for some reason, there was a green bean and a fettuccine in my dish - seems like a pretty careless kitchen! I get it, Olive Garden is a chain and expectations are pretty minimal. But this location in particular CANNOT handle a crowd. I would skip this and go to the Gateway Mall location. Also, no one offered us Parmesan cheese :(.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Still sitting here while I type this review. We are eating our warm entrees with plastic utensils after waiting over 5 minutes for them. Apparently they ran out of napkins and silver utensils. I should have known it was too good to be true when we got seated instantly. Terrible idea to come here. Wished I went to Lenny's clam bar instead for real authentic Italian food. Not this American franchise that runs out of utensils and that uses pictures that looks better than the food that comes out. I'm only giving them two stars because the waiters have no fault in this.

"After seeing commercials for Olive Garden, I was craving it. So on a Monday evening I went in. Surprised to be told there was a 10 minute wait when half the restaurant was empty, but it ended up being only 5 minutes- and I remember from being a hostess they usually overestimate the wait time. At the table was a tablet where you could look at the menu, order, pay, and play games. I was excited to play the trivia app but that quickly ended when it was $1.99 to play. No thanks! Our server was very friendly, and also a bit forgetful. I had to ask for a refill of bread-sticks and a cup of water twice. Not a huge deal breaker- just one aspect that could have been better. The food is your typical chain Italian fare. Not bad, not phenomenal- but definitely tasty. I went during the Never Ending Classics promotion which was a really great deal. I don't get to eat out a lot- and this made me happy about how my money was spent. Plus- they always give unlimited soup, salad, and bread sticks for all entrees which made the meal an even better value. But can we talk about the bread sticks for a second. So. Good. They're so addictive- especially when they first arrive at the table all warm and buttery. I'm sad to see so many others had a poor experience here- but it looks like it depends on when you go. I was happy overall and would go definitely go back when I get my craving again.",4.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"3 stars for the food 5 stars for service Always satisfied with the unlimited breadsticks, salad and soup (zuppa toscana is my choice).

Our entrees tasted ok but were a bit messy, like the make-your-own-lasagna; or small portions on a big white plate, like the stuffed chicken marsala.  Will skip  the toasted pork and beef ravioli next time .

"Ended up at Olive Garden on my birthday. Didn't expect much since it was a last minute decision to go there, and I celebrated mostly in the city prior to this. But good god even my minimal expectations weren't met. First off I ordered a Mule cocktail, partly my fault, haven't had one to date and I didn't like it. Server took it back I asked for a  light jack and coke. It came back light but add flat to that. Come and water and some jack. And ice cubes. To water it down even more. Literally left it sitting on the corner of the table. So here's the safety drink, give me a damn sprite. Then I order chicken Alfredo. Alfredo must've meant, the chefs name is Alfredo and he's going to make you the chicken and dry pasta, and also make sure to pull the pasta out before it's ready. I got some sauce. On top. Nothing in my pasta and yes I tried mixing it up but to no avail. I was going to bring all of this to the managers attention but I didn't want any blame to be associated to our servers because they actually were the ONLY positive experience there. So the wife paid the tab, and due to the experience in the escape room earlier in the day, we already knew how to slide out of that hellhole quickly. Best believe next time I want Olive Garden, I'll troop it to Manhattan. Even if this one here is close enough for me to sleepwalk to. Thanks. For nothing. Your food was trash.

Our movement...was so...slow...that it was...imperceptible. Amazing. Those restaurant lights must have really been messing with their vision. Poor, poor servers. Poor, poor eyesight.

"I haven eaten at Olive Garden before, but never has my meal been so... meh. There was a 15 minute wait when we entered on a Thursday around 2pm. We were seated and then things started to go down hill gradually. 1) We noticed our spoons were not that clean in our napkin sets- so we asked them to be replaced. When the second batch came back to us, they were still not looking that clean. By that time the waiter had brought our order of soup or salad with the lunch special (mostly soups in our case), we were still waiting on spoons. In the end we gave up on their silverware and asked for plastic spoons, but even that took some time to retrieve. My soup was getting cold so I started eating it with a fork! The waiter did apologize for the lack of clean spoons but it makes me wonder why he took so long if he knew we had our meal waiting already? 2) My order of meatball sandwich came with a side of fries. When I asked for ketchup the waiter replied they had run out of ketchup. I have never been denied ketchup before. I was even tempted to walk up to the take out window and ask if they had ketchup packets. Instead the waiter offered marinara sauce as a substitute. I later learned marinara sauce doesn't really work that great with fries. Who runs out of ketchup?! 3) My meatball sandwich really consisted of two whole meatballs sandwiched by a shorter saltier breadstick. There was so much salt on the bread my fingers were fully salted after holding the sandwich! I stared in awe as I did not realize the breadstick bread would be my sandwich bread. I didn't even realize there are only two full meatballs in the entire sandwich which was the length of an average hot dog bun. I only found that out by accident when I was trying to eat the sandwich and a meatball fell out from the bottom. It was then I had noticed it was cleanly cut in half, but I had not cut it at all. I was really disappointed in Olive Garden for making something look like there was more than there was. Olive Garden, I have grown into a better foodie since I've last been here in my youth. I can see where you are better saving that $7.99 extra for endless breadsticks and salad, and going to a place you will get quality food.

He brings us a salad and we said where's our soup? He said oh, ill bring your soups. At least we get to taste both soup and salad. He doesnt write our orders down which is good if you're flawless at remembering what we ordered. He isnt! He messes up my friends order. Instead of bringing spaghetti with meat sauce, he brings out a fettuccine alfredo. Wth? I ask for the red pepper flakes and he kept forgetting.

"I am giving it one star because I have to give a star to write review. I will like to start by saying I will never go back to this restaurant.... even if my meal is free. I waited 10 minutes to be seated and then was left there for about 10 more, mind you it was not really busy for a Friday 4:30 time. When finally the waitress arrived I was prepare to give my full order since it took her long enough. The drinks we ordered, one was not available that day and mine came out with no syrup so instead of a sprite I had Seltzer water. She fixed that by saying I could wait but she don't know how long it would be, so we settled for another drink. my daughter order a raspberry lemonade she settled for another suggestion from the waitress but it came out so fast we believe it was left by someone else, clearly a pity drink. So we order dessert which she actually brought over at the beginning of the meal (no I did not requested earlier) my daughter even had said to her we will have it right before we end our Entree.  Anyways to say the very least my daughter's Zeppoli were on the money nice and warm but my Cannoli's where frozen I did not notice till I bite down and had a hard surprise ....not happy. I told our waitress and she said she was surprise since as she said it was fresh. By fresh, she meant frozen solid, it was as hard as a rock. I'm almost positive a cannoli isn't suppose to be frozen solid. The waitress did take it off the bill when I spoke to her about it. The soup, salad and bread sticks come out, which was great because at this point I was starving, I had NO utensils to eat my food, so I had to wait till she came back around to ask her, which might I add took her a while to come around again. We finally get our Entrees. Mine was a chicken parmag dish. The dish felt like there was a overwhelming taste of pepper in it, it tickled my nose every time I brought a fork full of food to my mouth. My daughter's dish was the seafood alfredo. It started and ended with the hair that was in the dish.

"I personally had a very good time here. Although our main dishes came a little slow, all of it came at once after our appetizers. The waitress was very nice and caring. She can tell that it was my first time and helped me guide through it. The food itself was good. The pasta tasted good and was not dried. The breadsticks were warm and seasoned, and the calamari's were decently good. I can definitely see why families would come here. The dishes are somewhat big for one person to eat but I like having a bigger portion, saves money. Would def come back again!",4.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Good service the peach-mango smoothie is good. Especially the strawberry on the rim, so fresh and juicy :D but thennnnnn I order lobster ravioli. It's salty, edges of the pasta are hard to chew, sauce is oily, the shrimp that comes with it is way overcooked. Minestrone was more vegetables than broth, and also salty. Everything else was good though, like the fried mozzarella and the smoothie I got.",4.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"1 YELP STAR???? I would give it 0 stars if yelp had that option for me. First of all, my friend wanted to come to Olive Garden to try it. I went last time with another friend around the middle of the day so it wasn't really busy. THIS TIME, HOWEVER, it was kind of busy. However, we still went in. When we went in, we told them that we needed 4 seats. The lady in the front told us that it would take 15 minutes. So we were like okay, so we went to the entrance where there were seats. After 10 minutes we were still waiting. Then a whole family came in, and the lady with the short hair immediately seated them. I assume that the lady in the front wasn't paying attention because olive garden DOES NOT have reservations. My friend then went to the front and said how long do we have to wait. The lady again, said 15 minutes. That's when my friend got mad and said how come the party that came before us got seated. IM GUESSING the manager then arrived and the lady with the short hair got in trouble. We got seated immediately. (PS LOL why does it take someone to speak up for something to be done). Anyways, so we sit and we were given the menu. 10 MINUTES LATER, we were still not given water, or being served. the lady in the front, (she looked spanish and had a short brown hair), kept on staring at us, but refused service. Then another man came to the front desk, saw us, and didn't serve us. it has now been 20 minutes and still no service. Everytime we look at the front desk, the lady is staring exactly at us, but doesn't bother to do anything. That was until my friend finally went to the front desk and said ""you guys look bored, maybe you wouldn't be if you actually served us"". THAT WAS FINALLY, until someone came and served us. It seems like all the yelp reviews have one thing in common, bad customer service. Also, at the end of our meal I asked a server about the lady in the front and they said that she was new. Honestly, in my opinion, if you were a new employee, you should be working your ass off to find some regonition. Anyways, would I reccomend this place? Only if you want to wait 30 minutes to get served!!",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"okay so my family & i just came from eating here for my brother's graduation . first , it's freezing in the restaurant & it's central AC so there's no lowering it . we sat down & our server came about 1O min after we were seated & said ""Hi are you ready"" . no introduction , no welcome to Olive Garden . it's graduation week so i know it's busy but at least tell me your name . i'm a server at a restaurant so let's keep that in mind . took a while to get our drinks but the bar was busy so not a big deal . when the food came , my sister's alfredo was very bland . we asked our server (still don't know her name by the way) if she could get more sauce bc the dish was bland & barely had sauce . the server comes back with alfredo sauce that has a huge amount of salt & pepper that was clearly just added . you could actually see the salt packed on the top of the sauce . obviously she didn't eat the dish or ask for anything else . now this is the part that upset us . the bill came out to about $156 which is understandable for the amount of food & people . our server comes back after we give her the debit card with a Ziosk (small computer/tablet used to pay at restaurants with card) . i chose to give the server 2O% bc i know what it's like to serve & get nothing , and on top of that the food not being great isn't the server's fault . our server took the Ziosk right from my mother once her receipt popped out & TOOK HER OWN SURVEY . yes people , at the end of your payment Ziosk's give you the option to take a quick survey to see how your experience/service was & if you have any comments/concerns . my mom didn't know any better but our server did . don't take away our option to review our experience , that's how you get constructive criticism to help your restaurant get better . i'm pretty sure her numbers are high bc she probably takes her own surveys more than just this time , but the fact that we didn't have a good experience & you basically gave yourself your own pat on the back is pretty upsetting . i regret giving the 2O% but it is what it is . sorry Olive Garden , do better .",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I asked if the Sangarita was available in a pitcher size for the same price as the regular sangria which appears on the menu of $24. Of course I was told yes. When the the bill came they had added $30 to the cost of the $24 pitcher!  So when we complained they removed $15 from the bill. Strike two was when they said their location doesn't provide discounts for military members since it is at the discretion of the local franchise owner. I know my dollars will not be spent here ever again. Fool me once shame on you. Twice is a different story. There are lots of patriotic American owners who deserve my hard earned dollars and I chose to support them any day of the week. $100 for a mediocre meal?  Never again. Your results may vary but caveat emptor applies here. If you decide to chance it then make sure to ask for the final costs of anything you order that isn't specified on the menu in advance. Ps. My waiter Brandon was a cheerful and hardworking man who deserved the $20 tip.

"The worst Olive Garden ever! The service was awful. Entered tonight at 9 pm with my family and was immediately turned off by a hostess. Couldn't see her name because her tag was so small. When we entered the hostess made a comment saying ""why are people really walking in right now"". My mother was so upset asked to speak with the manager. He told her that they didn't close till 10 and the hostess claimed she did not make that comment. The night ended with our party walking out. Followed by myself as I went to use the bathroom. When I came out they had left and the staff was saying she doesn't even know why she's upset. Go figure.

I always get the mozzarella sticks and chicken flatbread for appetizer and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes for the entree when I come here and it never disappoints. The complimentary breadsticks and salad is such a nice touch to their wonderful menu. They always have amazing deals going on like, endless breadsticks or endless pasta bowl which is always why I convince myself to go here. I've been to this location numerous times and I've never had any complaints! If there was one thing that I wish they would work on, its their service.

"On 3/25/17 my niece decided to celebrate her 7th birthday here. I arrived at 5:45 and was given a wait time of 40-50 min for a party of 8. I said ok np. I asked how much longer at 6:50pm and I was told we were next and waiting for a big table to become vacant. I asked if two tables can be combined since we have 6 kids with us who are hungry and they last meal was lunch and we were told no. Now it's 7:35pm and I spoke to the manager and he was trying to accommodate us due to the long wait, but I was forced so make a scene after the 7th year old birthday girl began to cry because she was hungry and as soon as I began to yell and point out how parties of 5&6 were being seated and not us, the manager magically found 2 tables to place together.  To make matters worst the host named FAURIS was an ASSHOLE, was always on his phone, and he had a huge attitude problem when I asked his coworker the host that gave us the button how much longer after waiting 2 fucking hours to be seated and then another 20 minutes to place our order but the food came out fast we had two waitresses and the desserts were on the House.

Our waiter took forever to arrive, the cups were dirty, took forever to bring our drinks and appetizers. The appetizers were a disgusting mess -- we ordered a cheese dip that was essentially rubber and sent back, the fried lasagna thing was very bland and eventually thrown out. Our meals were dried out, under/over cooked, and/or had a weird odor. Waters were never brought despite us asking for a pitcher (we were a party of four); the wait staff constantly messed up our orders -- we asked for a salad without onions he brought us one with onions but no dressing when we told him he brought us a bowl of dressing and walked away, lol.

"I have to admit if it wasn't for the service manager Jamal this review wouldn't have made 5 stars. We arrived 8:20 on a Sunday night and there was a long wait. Go figure, it is family night, we were a family of 6. 30 minute wait turned into an hour because the hostess said "" there are no servers for the available seating you see"" so all the groups of 2-4 that came AFTER us were seated first AROUND the available tables. Scheduling of servers should be organized better for a Sunday. Next - the orders didn't come out at the same time, sadly the kids orders were last and they were sleepy by then. Oh and when 2nd set of salad/bread refill came out the waitress said ""sorry for the wait, it's close to closing time so the kitchen is putting stuff away"" - what does that have to do with us who came 8:20 ? I'd expect that comment from a club/lounge not a restaurant. After requesting for a manager and explaining, Jamal apologized on their behalf  and made everything right.

"Dined at this Olive Garden for the first time with my fiancé. We started off with the sampler appetizer and got the fried mozzerella, raviolis, and fried calamari. The fried calamari was very dried out. One of the fried mozzarella sticks were empty! How does that even happen? It was literally fried air. (See photo) Our entrees were okay. We both had pasta dishes that we have had in the past at another Olive Garden but for whatever reason is didn't taste as good here. My ziti was a little under cooked. As for the service- Our server was nice but a little bit of an air head. We sat and waited to be greeted and didn't come over until I stared him down and he realized. When our appetizer came out, we didn't have silverware or plates. By the time he brought them we were pretty much done with the appetizer. Throughout the whole experience he was pretty slow with everything. At the end of the meal he asked us to fill out a survey about his performance on the iPad at the table. He stood over my fiancé's shoulder as he was filling it out, of course to pressure him into giving him a good review. I don't go to Olive Garden too often, as I prefer authentic Italian food, however my fiancé and I both are obsessed with the salad and breadsticks, so we make an occasional visit to OG.

"After a miserable late morning of waiting at Time Warner Cable in Queens Center Mall, I wasn't in a mood for food court food. I walked out of the mall and noticed that the Olive Garden here is open and decided to give it a try. The last time I had Olive Garden was probably over 10 years ago in the dirty south and all I could remember as a kid was loving their breadsticks. During lunch hour, the dining room wasn't too packed. It was a weekday. The host sat us down and gave us the menus. We went with their 2 for 1 special that was one for dine-in and another for take-out. We decided fairly quickly on what we wanted. We waited.... and waited.... still not a server in sight. I was ready to walk out but my wife was starving and did not want to waste more time by walking back to the mall or to drive to another restaurant so we stayed put for a few more minutes until we finally spotted another waitress covering another section of the restaurant. We called her over and she was surprised that no one came to us to at least take our beverage orders. After this waitress took down our orders, our soups and salads arrived rather fast. The soups were meh. They tasted like they were made from a concoction of Campbell's and Progresso soup cans. The gnocchi sucks. Every soup we tried was crap. Our entrees followed but the breadsticks.... she kept forgetting to bring the breadsticks. The special came with unlimited choice of soup or salad. I like to dip the breadsticks into the soup or pasta sauce but it was just too late by the time it arrived. We've already finished our entrees but the good part was, we got to bring them home to compliment it with the take out part of the special. The pasta I chose was the Cavatappi w/ Asiago Garlic Alfredo. It was pretty cheesy and garlicky. It tasted like it was frozen and heated from a microwave. I ordered the same pasta to-go hoping it might be different but it was literally a frozen package of the same pasta with re-heating instructions. Verdict - It's poorly made Italian cuisine. The service was poor and the quality was just not there. The breadsticks I once loved came late and did not have the stomach or time to enjoy. It's pretty sad when it comes down to the breadsticks being the high point of ""customer satisfaction"".",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"This is my second time reviewing this restaurant location; my star rating has not changed.  If you have ever tasted authentic Italian food by real Italian chefs, you will understand why.  The food here in Olive Garden is certainly good, but it is slightly pricey for the quality.  At this particular visit, I was asked if I wanted a water bottle instead of tap water and a side of vegetables with my main dish, so the staff is intent at making the most money out of every customer.  Just be aware that your mind isn't being tricked into spending more than you originally wanted to.

"Never again will I visit this location (across from Queens center mall) When we arrived everything was going smooth. The hostess at the door welcomed us and told us it was a 30 min wait, so we waited at the bar. Then we finally got to our table. First we ordered drinks and he forgot one of our drinks. We understand that happens sometimes but we had to ask him two times before he brought it us. Then we ordered appetizers which came before our salad and breadsticks. So basically we sat there for about 20 mins with only our drinks. After we got our appetizer we asked him where is our salad and breadsticks?  Then he finally brought it out at the same time we got out entree. I've been to many different Olive Garden locations and never had a problem. At the other locations the waiter would immediately bring out the salad and the breadsticks and when our entree would arrive they would ask if we would like Parmesan on our food. But not this waiter!! We had to ask him for everything, basically. While he was being distracted by two females at another table. He gave us very poor customer service. I did tip him the min 15% which after thinking about the whole dining experience, I regret even giving him a dime. If this was my first time at Olive Garden I would of had a very bad impression of it. Oh and I forgot to mention that the chef had to come out of the kitchen to ask me what kind of sauce did I want on my pasta because the waiter failed to ask. One more thing, we ordered a refill of soda and AGAIN he forgets to bring it. Like I said he was busy chatting with some girls at the other table.

Chicken fingers were moist and better than other chicken fingers that we had elsewhere.  The serving was huge. Dessert: 1) Lemon Cake - OMG! I love this cake!!!!

"I came on a date on a Friday night. It was not overly crowded, and that should have tipped me off. We were seated immediately. I ordered a Chianti to drink and the waitress went toffee to prepare it. She came back and took our dinner order, the wine not yet delivered. I ordered the cavatappi with vodka sauce and Sausage. My date ordered the whole wheat fettuccine with five cheese marinara sauce and chicken. The waitress came back to ask if we wanted cheese on our salads. A little later she returned with eh salad and bread sticks. Still no wine. 30 minutes into the our visit our food came...not bad on timing. It went down from here. At this point my date realized the chicken was improperly thawed and cooked. All of it was put to the side. It was then she brought the wine, opened it, and poured it. I felt bad for her because the corkscrew was cheap and it broke the cork in several pieces. It was also quite clear she had not been trained on how to serve wine. It should be something the restaurant could offer the staff. We informed her of the chicken and she took it away. I also asked if there was grated cheese. She said there was and left. Fifteen minutes passed and no cheese appeared. No followup on how dinner was. I pushed the call button on the new table kiosks. Ten minutes passed and still no response and no cheese. My food had begun to be cold. Eventually, I turned around and saw our waitress was hanging out at the host desk. My date had informed me that she had looked our way several times, but did not come. I blatantly turned and got her attention. She came over and I asked about the cheese. She said she would get it. By this point my food was cold, and my date had finished their chicken less pasta. She offered to have my food microwaved. I informed her that pasta doesn't work that way in a restaurant, and that it was so late in the meal I didn't want it any longer. She did not apologize, but did take my plate. We expected at this point that some manager would have stepped in...two meals unsatisfactory, one customer not even able to finish his meal. No one came. We decided to use the kiosk to pay for our meal, to learn that my whole meal was included...no discount..nothing. I asked my date if it was ok to get the manager. Given the go-ahead, I went to the host station and asked if there was a manager. The manager happened to be there. He listened to my situation and said he would take care of it. He brought me a bill with my meal removed, and the chicken removed from my dates meal. I was fine paying for the late arriving wine...since it ended up being my only meal. What was strange is the server came up, didn't apologize, but tendered our bill. I am not sure why the service was so poor. Part of me feels it was because we were a gay couple. I did not feel welcome, Nor that my waitress wanted to serve us. My hope is it was just bad training and apathy--but honestly I don't know. I give this place one star. I intend to come back and hope to give a more positive review. But right now, I can only advise to be cautious when taking a date there.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Sucks to wait for a table..it can take a while.  We go there sometimes if we have a coupon or gift card.  The soups and breadsticks are always awesome but the food is average.  I come from a long line of italian cooking so this frozen processed stuff isnt really for me...but give me some of that sausage potato and kale soup anytime..,3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
The drinks are super cheap. Got 2 wines for 8 bucks . I been to places were its at least 12 for one.  The sitting was fast as well. I was told it was going to be 35-40 minutes wait but we were sitting in 10 minutes . The only hung that sucks is they were out of a few things we wanted to order: one being the lobster ravioli that came with most of the holiday menu items . I got a steak with the gorgonzola cheese and Alfredo sauce . Soooo good. I am also very happy with the quality of the kids meals. I got my daughter the chicken fingers with spaghetti and it cam with broccoli. It was soft chicken and a good size .,5.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

He didn't care that his employee had said I could use it, there was no info actually on the coupon stating it was for dine in only, or that I had ordered more to-go than most customers order when dining in.

Inedible food almost. Had the spaghetti with meatballs and could only eat 1/4 of it since it was so unappetizing and tasteless. I could've saved more money with a can of Chef Boyardi pasta.

I ordered from the buy one get one menu and had the chicken con broccoli pot pie, and let me tell you it was absolutely delicious. It's basically chicken with broccoli in an Alfredo sauce in this huge baked pot pie shell. The ingredients were perfectly blended, and it was hot straight out of the oven. I ended up getting the same order to take home for the BOGO special. I also ordered the pumpkin pie cheese cake which was a perfect ending for my meal.

Ever since they opened up near my neighborhood I've been contemplating whether to go in or not. It was just a matter of what time to go. It is ALWAYS packed. I understand there aren't many olive gardens in queens so that could explain why. I've been here twice and I didn't have a bad experience at all.

"5 stars you wonder? Well, I'll explain why I would give a food chain 5 stars: I am basing my rating on other factors than the food, because let's face it, do you really expect gourmet, high quality taste/ingredients, authentic Italian cooking, from Olive Garden of all places? There are hundreds of authentic, yet pricier, places to try all over NY. So, I come here for a quick, convenient, cheap bite to eat. So what I am really looking for is service, and the fact that the food was tasty/edible enough. Let's be real here, people! I went on two different occasions and had exceptional waiters -- maybe just lucky? Once was a guy named Anthony, another time with Michael. Both were personable and friendly. They didn't really stay to chit chat, but you could tell they were laid back, welcoming, while also being efficient and attentive. I really appreciate that kind of balance. Anthony was super cool and offered my dad a soup container to go. It was the little things like that which made a difference. Bathrooms: One large one near the takeout kitchen, and it was clean. Dirty napkins or toilet paper weren't on the floor. everything looked really organized and in its place. Wait times: I've always gone at odd hours for lunch or late lunch, both weekdays and weekends. Weekends are obviously busier, but since we were just a couple, we were seated quicker as opposed to a larger table. Now I know the food is mediocre and basically formula food -- not really fresh ingredients. But I have to admit that I really love their calamari. It's more breading than anything, but it tastes better that way (in my opinion), almost like an onion ring! Bruschetta is so-so, a lot more balsamic taste to it. The fried lasagna appetizer sounds good on paper, but just made with too much cheese, and the ratio of filling to the actual noodle/breading was off. They also have a parking lot, but I think you have to pay for it, otherwise everyone and their mother would be stealing those spots to hit the mall or something.",5.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Afterwards the waiter seemed to notice my upset face & fixed himself up. He got us bread sticks & salad & my boyfriend got soup. Which was all unlimited. He brought us our drinks and as soon as we finish everything our food comes! He offered some more soup and was very attentive to our needs. I liked that.

Once he finally graced us with his attention, I had to ask more than once for a menu and was given an attitude about that. Additionally Asking for basic things like the shredded cheese on the salad was another issue met with attitude. Requesting more bread/salad from a place that advertises that it's unlimited was an even bigger issue.

I never thought I'd ever see my life flash through my eyes at a shitty Italian chain restaurant. When I say I almost died I am not even joking. I went to Olive Garden giving it a second chance since my last visit to the one in Centereach. They killed that chance faster than the downfall of every kid celebrities career. There were people celebrating a birthday and everything was cool until out of no where someone yelled bitch. After that all I heard were the screams of children and women. These two men started throwing glasses and FULL wine bottles across the restaurant crashing all over the place which resulted in wine smashing on other people in the restaurant. I was so scared that I'd get hit I didn't even get my food served to me yet and I got the check and the food and left immediately hardly able to breath do to the crippling panic attack I had received from this terrible gut wrenching experience.

Our waiter could have paid just a little more attention to detail( one shouldn't have to ask for water,silverware,soda refills ,ect.),however,he was charming and accommodating and that definitely made up for everything else.My husband had the Linguine di mare and it was tasteless and bland; I don't recommend it. Everything else was delicious.Their apple pie ala mode is amazing.I hope management reads these reviews and addresses the bathroom upkeep and attention to detail with staff,because this is a beautiful restaurant in a great location ,with great potential.I would like to think that their location ( right next to Queens Mall),which pretty much guarantees a certain amount of business, doesn't make the management complacent.I would definitely return to this restaurant and give it another chance.",3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Concur with all the negative reviews. Someone in upper management should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and I have started my own business. I can't even fault the incapable staff as much as whoever trained or whoever didn't train them. Will not be back.,1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Had a great experience today and we owe all to the great server we had Mardaly F. She was attentive , fast and accurate.  The food was so good . She made some good recommendation that we enjoyed. She recommended  the appetizer smoked mozz fonduta and it was so good... the crispy salad and warm breadsticks were served on time. The main dishes came at a good time also. She asked a constantly enough to make sure we were ok. One of the best experiences we hav had at this location. Was just about to give up on it and today with the exceptional service we got has revived my faith.

"Well I was extremely happy they added an Olive Garden to the Queens area and in such a perfect location. My girlfriends and I waited literally a week in a half to gather here and enjoy their unlimited bread sticks and salad along with some good Italian rustic food not to mention a little wine (a lot..hehe). Since we were a total of 3 we got sat pretty quick, the exterior of the restaurant is beautiful as well as inside, looks great. Our waiter was very professional so that helped. NOW...THE FOOD.. So for appetizers we ordered the artichoke fritti which is basically artichoke hearts battered and fried, now usually the artichoke hearts I've seen are about the size or a table spoon if not slightly bigger these were probably the size of a gumball and were flimsy which was disappointing to see for an app not including the fact there were only about 10 very small pieces so the plate just look sad and frazzled but the taste was good. So one of my girlfriends ordered the ravioli the sauce display was disappointing and quoting her she said ''it taste like Styrofoam"" I'm sure she hasn't eaten Styrofoam before but I got the jist. Our other girlfriend ordered the portobello ravioli which was actually pretty good but have to mention sauce was disappointing as well but overall good dish. I ordered the eggplant parm (no cheese/vegan) it looked awful, the eggplant was super greasy and not in a good way it seemed very over cooked sauce was bland and to me it just felt like they had one job and they half assed it. Call me old school but I feel food should be cooked with some love, if this place wants to stay in business then they have to hire some people that enjoy cooking or maybe sign their kitchen staff up to some 101 cooking classes, I can whip up a better sauce FROM A CAN!.. so what gives? Anyways I probably wont be back which is sad because this place is a gem and Queens is my hometown so anything new and adds revenue I think is amazing. They need to stop treating the food like its a fast food joint cause it clearly isn't although a franchise the Olive Garden in Time Square their food was very good. Hope management reads this I'd love to see this place upgrade.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"We were invited in in their ""Friends and Family night""!  My daughter and I had a blast. Great music and delicious food. We started with fried calamari (could've been sliced a little thinner-but delicious!).  Also, gnocchi soup-soft pillows of gnocchi. If I had a nonna I'm sure she would've made them just like this....*gnocchi.daze* We shared Gorgonzola steak medallions with pasta, Mmmmmm.  Also, seafood fettuccini-we almost had a fork fight!  Lol.

If i could give no stars i would ....this place will never get my money again. First strike ... Was told 10 mins for a wait.. Waited 30 mins because they forgot about us. I had the buzzer in my hand and everything. Told me i must have left the place. Yet i was sitting 5 feet away from them. Mulitple familys kept getting seated that came in after us. Which is what made me get up and say something. Second stike..waitress didnt come to our table for atleast 10 mins after we were seated... We placed our drink and food order asap (we are straving at this point) then our salads and breadsticks came before drinks. We had to ask for 2 cokes twice.. We got our food it was warm and decent. Never did we get asked if we needed refills or how our food was. Then we waited for about 20 to 30 mins finally i grabbed another waiter to get us the check. Once she finally came to us about 7 mins after she took our payment went to her other tables. About 5 more mins later she came back told us were to sign and disappeared never saw her again. Its a true shame how pourly run this place is. First time i ever went food came out ice cold. Figured we wiuld give them another shot. But you will never get money for us again. Its a shame not even a manager walks around asking how things are. In EVERY olive garden i have ever been in.

"Ok so it's Olive Garden, the food is pretty consistent across the chain. So I am reviewing service. Went here for a weekday lunch, two adults, two toddlers. It was not a ghost town but it was definitely more empty than full, and there seemed to be plenty of staff on hand. Our waitress was very pleasant and smiled etc throughout. However she was pretty incompetent. We ordered an appetizer and two kids meals via the tabletop touchscreen. It asked how many plates we wanted with the appetizer, we clicked four. We got: zero. Ordered drinks from our waitress, 2 ice teas for adults, 2 waters for kids. Ice teas came, no water. Asked for water again. Food came, no water. Asked again. Water, for toddlers, came: in two 16oz glass open-top glasses. Fine we put straws in and try to monitor kids. But the inevitable happens and there is a spill. We ask for extra napkins, we're never given any. I had to grab utensil rolls from another [empty] table. When the kids meals were served they included a bowl of grapes (we selected them as a side). But grapes for toddlers need to be cut. This is not a problem, but the waitress choosing this moment to ask us questions is quite distracting as I have toddlers clamoring for  grapes as I am trying to cut and a grown woman seemingly obvious to this asking me about my meal. The menu, and indeed every advertisement Olive Garden puts out, promised ""unlimited breadsticks"" with our meal. We got absolutely NO breadsticks at all. I heard another nearby table also complain about this. Drinks are unlimited as well, but we were only offered a refill once, and since I had half a glass at the time it was not refilled. Ever. The restroom - singular, as in one unisex toilet apparently for the whole restaurant  (or perhaps just our side?) had a changing table (great!) but no wall hook or shelf, so the diaper bag had to placed on the restroom floor. The food was fine, no complaints, nothing amazing, but the service was just sad.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I was at the mall and has a sudden craving for OG soup so I came here on a week day around lunch time. There was a good amount of people but I sat right away. I ordered the soup and salad combo, it was decent just like any other Olive Garden I've been to. I really hate that people complain about OG food it's obviously not authentic Italian it's just a fast place to go when the cravings hit. The only negative thing I would say is the service sometimes sucks. I usually eat at the bar area at the tables but that section doesn't have servers so the bartender has to juggle customers and patrons at the bar. I get if you're busy I have to wait but the bartender was talking to another employee through that little window totally disregarding I wanted more soup. I'm not one to yell in a  restaurant  but that was the only way to get his attention because I was waiting for over 10 minutes and even started waving at one point. By the time he got around to it I was full So I had to take it to go.

"I was completely dissatisfied with the customer services at this Olive Garden. Our waiter, Yian was really welcoming and friendly at first. He gave us a run-down of the menu and asked if we wanted to try the wine samples and such. We stuck to water. The four of us ordered the Seafood Alfredo, Northern Tour of Italy, a 3 Choice Appetizer Sampler with Calamari, Fried Mozzarella and Toasted Ravioli and two Create Your Own Pasta, a Tri Color Penne Asiago Garlic Alfredo with add on Shrimp and Bucatini with Primavera Sauce with two Chicken meatballs add on. We asked for two house salads and two soups; Fagioli and Chicken & Gnocchi. Here's when his recommendation scheme comes in. He suggests all these fancy sauces that ""would go well with our breadsticks and will enhance and intensify and bring out the flavor"". We chose the Meat Sauce and Alfredo. Little did we know it costs extra for those sauces. Then he asked if we each wanted to add any vegetables to our pasta given the choices of asparagus, broccoli, and spinach without letting us know there would be an extra charge as well. So we asked for veggies in our pasta. The soups, breadsticks and salads came out really quick. For the house salad I usually ask them to put the dressing on the side because it can get really salty. The two soups were salty as well. Our pastas came afterwards except the Northern Tour of Italy. We waited 30 minutes after and there were no sign of our last dish. The waiter did not check on us if we were missing anything. We had to chase him down every time he was near our table because he was always missing. When we finally got his attention he responds back saying, ""Oh did you not tell the waiter who brought out the food that you were missing a dish?"" First of all that runner, a poor little girl was carrying three big plates of food to our table all by herself. We assumed she was going to come back with the fourth plate after she gave us the first three dishes. We're not the type to rush for our food because we understand that it was dinner time and orders can be backed up. We were really unhappy when the waiter, YIAN, asked ""Well you should of let her know that you were missing something"" That girl was not even in charge of our table. She only brought over the food once. She never came back afterwards. I believe this is completely ridiculous for Yian to tell us what to do because as our waiter he should've made sure that everything was okay and if we were missing anything. He never checked on us. However he was so attentive to the family of 6 that sat right behind us. Yian gave them the best fine dining experience. He also made small talks with them and got the whole table to laugh. After taking their orders, he did not even make way to come over to see if everything was okay. So we continued to wait for our last dish the Northern Tour of Italy. When her dish finally came we asked for a refill on our salad. It took him 15 minutes to come back with our second bowl of salad. We finally started eating our pastas. Everything was way too salty. My pasta was dry and didn't have enough sauce. None of our pastas came with the vegetable that we asked for. When we asked for our third bowl of salad he was quite hesitant about giving it to us. When we ask for the check, he comes over and tells us that he will be charging us for the third bowl of salad since we all shared it. I gave him a good 20 second stare. My friend said its okay just let him charge us. But I looked around and told him, only two of us ate the salad. The other two ate soup. You're really going to charge me extra for a salad refill? What happen to unlimited salads? I didn't even complain about the extra charge on the vegetables which we didn't even get. He then changed his mind and said, ""Oh if that's the case then I won't charge you for the extra salad then"" He made it sound like he was doing us a favor. I'm pretty sure he was just following Olive Garden's policy that you have to charge a table extra if you see them sharing a plate of salad. But I'm also sure Olive Garden prioritizes customer service and customer satisfaction before anything else. If he saw how long it took us to get our food, he shouldn't even mention to us about charging extra for a salad refill. He really doesn't know how to make his customers happy. He was really good at catering to the table behind us but left us hanging with missing food and empty glasses of water. Maybe he's just being selective with his customers. And the waiter knew he was wrong because when he came back with the receipt he didn't even mention about how we should fill out the customer survey on the bottom of the receipt about his services. He definitely did mention it to the table behind us and how leaving feedback will definitely help him out. We're not going back for a while. I rather go next door to Joe's Crab Shack and Longhorn Steakhouse. The other Olive Garden's has top notched service. Too bad this one doesn't.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This is my second time dining at an olive garden chain restaurant. I like this atmosphere much better than the one located in times square. Restaurant is pretty big and has a large parking spot. Overall my experience wasn't the best. My waiter was not helpful at all. The menu is somewhat foreign to me since I barely eat Italian cuisine. When I asked the waiter which soup you recommend and which dipping sauce do you recommend and his boring response were, THEY ALL TASTE GREAT. Well, sir- no not really- according to my little taste buds. I ordered Shrimp Pasta and even though they served a generous amount of shrimp- the shrimps were not cooked properly.

"I have been in the food industry for over 10 years, and have worked in high volume fast food places where flipping tables in the main priority, I have also worked in catering where your are supposed to stay out of the way yet completely attentive, and I have also worked in michelin star rated restaurants where a bottle of wine can start at eight hundred.  That being said I have a really great understanding of what goes in BOH as well a FOH.  Last night I decided to have dinner within walking distance of my home, and i chose olive garden. I didn't expect or even want a ""fancy""dinner, thats not why i went.  I just wanted some decent tasting food.  I arrive at the olive garden located in Elmhurst (92-10 59th Avenue Elmhurst, NY 11373) at about ten pm, and the hostess instantly starts walking us to be seated.  Considering it was an hour to closing, on a Sunday, which was not a holiday, it safe to assume the location wasn't exactly packed.  However the hostess directed us to a table which still had a large bowl of food on it as well as breadsticks.  She lifts the items, set down the menus, utensils, and mentions a bus boy.  The server then arrives, and places glasses of water on the table. I then request someone to clean the table and i inform him why.  He offers me to move to a different location and I do.  This table however had a cruton on the side of the chair and lettuce in the crease of the seat and backrest, as well as a  sugar caddy (which should only present for desert of warm beverages) as well as a empty (although clean) wine glass.  I decided to not say anything but I wait or the server to arrive so i can very obviously remove them in front him which i do, and they remained right next to me for the rest of my visit.  When the busser was notified of both of these things he visually scanned the area and basically shrugged it off like ""whatever we are almost done anyway.""

"We went on Halloween night, a little bit of a wait was expected. We were seated and had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter to great us. We order everything at once since we had the time to think it over. We ordered two ice waters and then our entrees. We continued to wait, and our salad and breadsticks came but still nothing to drink. She informed us that they ran out of crotons. A bus boy later brought us our drinks and didn't say a word, very awkward. We finished our salad, having it only be two of us, we were hoping for more. But we hadn't seen our waiter. 45 minutes and we're sitting there with an empty salad and growing increasingly hungry. I went to the front desk asking for a new waiter or to talk with a manager. The manger came by and we explained to him that we were waiting but no one was coming by and asking how we were, or if we needed anything. He apologized, said we could get a dessert on the house and he would give us some type of discount for the poor service. Our entrees come, no question if we wanted grated cheese or not. The meal itself was great. We were getting tired, it was past 10 and we had been there for awhile. I asked for my pasta to be boxed, and she gave me a box to box it myself. Never have I been to an Olive Garden where I box my own leftovers. The manager took our pay kiosk earlier to fix what he mentioned earlier. We waited another 10 minutes for the bill that had a $3 drink on there that we didn't order, and no type of discount. We did argue, and paid for it because we knew it would take too long for it to be fixed.

"I know this is a chain restaurant so I don't expect high quality food. BUT I WAS IMPRESSED. I love my waitress. Her name was Brenda M. and she was awesome! She was on top of things. I didn't have to flag down her and she surprised me when she said I could get ultimate soup with my entrée. Anyways lets back up a bit. It was a Saturday night at 8pm. It was packed as always. The wait was around 45 minutes. I hated how crowded the front was but that's a problem no matter where I would go on a Saturday night. We got seated at exactly the estimate time was. Brenda our waitress came to our table to see if we wanted to try a sample of the wine she was holding. We kindly declined since we weren't wine drinkers. I ordered classic calamari for appetizers: (Rating:3/5) Portion was pretty small but hey it's an appetizer. It came with white and red sauce. It wasn't the best. It wasn't too rubbery but the flavor was lacking. I was happy that at least there was more squid than dough. For entree I got the Lasagna Classico with Chicken & Gnocchi soup on the side: (Rating: 5/5) Lasagna was small but omg do not underestimate it. I couldn't finish it. The lasagna was the size of the palm of a hand. I only ate half. It was heavy in meat and sauce. To top it off the soup was ammmmazzzzziiinnngg! I had two bowl of soup. Yea my stomach was saying SAVE THE LASAGNA! I love the lasagna because it was a good balance of meat, sauce and pasta. It looked small but wait until you eat it. The soup wasn't so creamy, it had a few Gnocchi and lots of chicken, and it was unlimited. I was unaware it was unlimited. When Brenda came to my table and asked if I wanted more that made my night. I love soup! My fiancée ordered the tour of northern Italy: (Rating: 5/5) I tried a little bit of his meal and it was surprisingly very delicious. The mushroom in the pasta stood out the most, The chicken parmesan was well breaded, and I forgot the third one but I didn't get to try it out. He loved it and he couldn't finish his meal too. I wish this limited special would stay on the menu. Bread sticks is always a billion thumbs up!!!!! It is also unlimited too!!! Overall: I would definitely come back! I got a lot more to try and I don't mind the wait. Plus side they have a shared parking lot with longhorn steak house.

"What can I say that people havent write about Olive Garden. Olive Garden has always the most cozy and beautiful environment for any occassion. The salads and breads are always on point and yummy Even the food looks and taste good, however everytime I dine at Olive Garden no matter which one I end up with my acid going up the scale and barfing all over my toilet. Decor: outside and inside its beautiful, very cozy Food: I had salad, breadsticks, and shrimp linguini with some wine. Salad and bread were fast, the main entree took a while, I thought they went to catch the shrimps somewhere lol Drinks: I had red wine, (california, they dont serve italian wine) and it was too acid. In general, I have always had a good dining experience at Olive Garden but then a few hours later my stomach says otherwise. Maybe is the oil, maybe is the salad who knows! However I noticed the service at this place was slower than usual and parking is a nightmare.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
This place is around the corner for me and after going 3 times I just can't anymore! 1st time it was horrible... went to celebrate a friends birthday and the waiter tells us would you like to try some sauces for the bread-sticks... of course i say yea! they sauces were good... we order drinks and he took forever and brought the wrong drinks.. the food took forever and and it was cold! when the bill came we saw that he charged of for the sauce! when we asked him about it he says thats part of an appetizer!!! they could have said something before ordering and also could have stop refilling it if he was going to charge us every time! 2nd time the waiter was better the the food again! took forever! and cold!!! 3rd time was super busy! was told to wait 20-30 minutes.... an hour later i go up and ask they tell me the lady never put our names on the list.... than why do you have about 6 people in the front not helping... when we were seated the waiter seemed nice and than forgot about is... no refill on drink no refill on bread sticks nothing! Finally the food was good but we had order were you can order one in the store and take a 2nd home... so once we got home we noticed that in the container it was only pasta alone! no sauce no chicken nothing!!!! just plan pasta!

"I went in a group of six and we were seated right away and the staff was very friendly. I ordered the tour of italy which is a plate with Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna Classico and Fettuccine Alfredo. The salad they brought before the entree had a weird smelling dressing and the cheese sauce my friends got for dipping the bread sticks in wasn't good. The breadsticks were kind of hit or miss, with some being perfect and others soggy with oil or too salty. The chicken was good, the lasagna was alright, and the fettuccine was almost flavorless (had to mix it with some of the sauce and cheese from the other two parts). I kind of expected more from it but I did finish and it got me full so mission accomplished I guess. Overall me and my friends weren't really liking the place too much. We felt bad for giving a bad tip, because the waiter was friendly and a really cool guy. But, we were having issues splitting the bill amongst ourselves with some paying in cash and others paying with credit cards and then figuring out how split up tax and tip. If olive garden had an option to split the bill as we were ordering, we wouldn't have spent so much time calculating it ourselves and we would have been able to tip more. But sadly there wasn't much else we could do and the waiter ended up suffering for it. With so many better restaurants in the area it's hard for us to justify coming back.",3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Ok, she sat us soon after ....walking through the restaurant, I see tables upon tables that are empty!! There was an entire room with all but one empty tables! I believe they make people wait 40 minutes just to build a hype...in reality, they are loosing potential customers as many people walk out! The entire restaurant was cold...no heat!

The food was horrible. Please fire your cook. I've been to other olive garden and never had this issue. If management doesn't realize the quality is not good. Then corporate needs to step in or something. Tell your cooks and servers to ask themselves if they would eat what they serve/cook. On top of that the bill was not cheap. We should of complain to the manager. The salad and bread was 10x better than the main course. Get it together please.

I ordered Chicken Alfredo and my boyfriend ordered a three piece meal with chicken parm, chicken Alfredo and something else I cannot remember. I ordered a strawberry mango margarita and he ordered a raspberry lemonade. I am familiar with the fact that we get salad and bread sticks on the house. Those took a while to get there but no biggy. The salad and the bread sticks were the best part of our entire meal. The margarita tasted disgusting as if whatever syrup they put in it was not mixed. I could barely drink it. My boyfriends drink was out of stock so he orders lemonade and it tasted horrible as well. The amazing server offered him another drink and that tasted fine. Now to get to the food. IT WAS SO BLAND.

"ok, i get it - it's the olive garden, but my 5 year old loves the bread sticks. Yelp won't allow me to give it no stars so that's the only reason i gave it any. My visit was this past Sunday 11/30/14. so we get there and are told it's about a 30 minute wait - 1 hour later our buzzer finally goes off, the hostess collects it then has us standing staring at her for another 20 minutes because she placed it down with a bunch of other buzzers that went off and lost track and now basically everyone is bum rushing and cutting everyone off - FINALLY after an hour and a half - they seat us. Takes another 15 for a waiter to come by, then we place our orders immediately. I specify i am getting an appetizer as an entree- yet not only do i get my food first - it takes another 20 minutes for my waiter to re-appear and only after asking 3 more times, does my kid and husband's meal finally appear. A child's meal should be the first meal out and a parent shouldn't have to ask more than once where it is - second you should never bring out one person's plate so that other people at the table are waiting and watching them eat. Again - our waiter is gone - i have to ask a different waiter to find him so i can place a drink order. Highly unorganized. Chaotic. It's Olive Garden - we know it's not 5 star cuisine but it's basically the fast food equivalent of Italian Food so what we dealt with was beyond unacceptable. We spent more time waiting than eating. If you couldn't handle the foot traffic then you picked the wrong location to open this - either that or re-train your staff.

"I've had great Olive Garden experiences before, and this place is just terrible. We decided to go on a Monday night, and it was super crowded. I'll break down the categories: Service: The service was slow. I know it was crowded but the hostesses were all super disorganized, and they looked overwhelmed (and all about 18). A bus boy was at the Hostess stand when he was yelled at by a woman who said ""No busboys at the hostess stand"", and then yelled at him in Spanish. Unprofessional much? Our server herself was sweet. Liz deserves a raise guys, because she was the only ""nice"" thing about this location at all. Food: No. Just absolutely terrible. I decided to get the Pappardelle Pescatore. When you cook pasta, you need to add olive oil to it immediately so it won't stick due to the starchiness. Guess what? I had a massive mound of pasta. The sauce wasn't properly seasoned AND the clams were definitely frozen and barely had any meat inside. I was so disappointed. I know Olive Garden is basically the McDonalds of Italian fine dining, but this was terrible! Also, guys, the breadsticks aren't that great. They're basically hotdog bread dipped in over salted butter. I'm never going here again.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"If I could put a 0 I would, first and foremost they didn't have two dishes available anymore. As a servers job they should've addressed that to the customer prior before ordering. My parents placed their orders ahead of mine and I placed mine after their order was delivered. My mother's linguini wasn't fully cooked from her pasta. My pasta also wasn't fully cooked. I'm already aggravated because they didn't have originally what I wanted the least they could've did was make sure my food was prepared correctly. I will NEVER go to Olive Garden on a weekend or on holiday because they run out of food and the cohesiveness of cooking quality is HORRIBLE. I'm highly disappointed and upset.

I couldn't help but laugh because that was beyond tacky. Appetizers: Nasty. Salad: Pretty good. Bread sticks: Delicious! Entree: It was really disgusting. It's utterly sickening that they consider Olive Garden authentic Italian food. Honestly, if i was an Italian I would feel really offended and start a petition to get this food chain closed. Me and my friend ordered the 5 cheese ziti, and I'm pretty sure the ziti is supposed to be baked since it looks baked in every single advertisement and on the menu provided online. Instead, we were given ziti pasta with flavorless sauce with Parmesan cheese. What happened to the 4 other cheeses? God only knows.

"I have never in my entire life received such poor service in my entire life. Our day was so beautiful until my family and I entered this Olive Garden. We arrived at Olive Garden at 4pm, we sat down at 4:55 pm. The waiter (Raven) came and we told her we wanted separate checks. She told us she would separate everything at the end. I knew something was wrong when she began putting our orders on 1 paper. It took them 20 mins to bring us drinks, 15 mins to bring us bread and salad (we were only given 2 salads and 2 baskets of bread for 12 people and 1 child) and an additional 25 mins for our appetizers. The time is now approximately 5:55pm. Our dinner comes out and we eat and now the best part......THE CHECK. Ms. Raven (sarcastic voice) brings one check and we tell her we wanted everything separate and she says ok how you want to split the bill. Apparently separate checks and splitting a bill is the same thing in her eyes.......we then ask her to bring us a machine of which we can pay for our own items and her response was ""oh i have to put your orders myself in at the register"". if a TIP is what she was trying to get because of the amount of people we were with, this was not the approach. It was 7 0'clock when asked for the check. After asking for a manager, it took Ms.Raven (sarcastic voice) 45 MINUTES, not seconds but 45 MINUTES to separate our checks. After countless mistakes, paper wasted, and of coarse OUR PRECIOUS TIME, the checks were finally separated. I am very disgusted with this service, oh and to top it all off, it was my best friends moms birthday and we were all out to celebrate it.

I got the seafood pasta and would recommend like the waitress said to only get the shrimp. The scallops didn't taste great and were rather fishy tasting than usual. The sampler plate for appetizer is a good choice I guess. The calamari was okay, but I wouldn't recommend getting the one filled with cheese because there was only about 4 pieces. Not worth getting. Also, the stuffed mushrooms were quite a few, but didn't taste great after sitting on the table when no one was eating it.

"This spot is fairly new and right across from the mall. I've eaten at Olive Garden plenty of times (Brooklyn location and Long Island)but never at this spot. I originally wanted to give the steak house a try but kids and husband wanted ""Italian"" .all staff members did the job they were trained to do and pleasant enough. As soon as my food was brought out (chicken Parmesan) I was immediately disappointed. The kitchen must of been running low on sauce , cheeses and pasta . It looked as though I ordered from the kids menu. The portion on this was almost something to  laugh at. I know what serving sizes are at Olive Garden and we always take left overs got the next day. Not here. The chicken sat there dry as can be with a finger size thin slice of cheese ( was that the Parm part?) spaghetti looked like a portion size from weight watchers. Thank god for breadsticks. My husband ordered a salmon that couldn't have been any drier .  At the end after I filled up on breadsticks my daughter ordered a Sundae.

"I'm officially done with this place. The workers here are so unfriendly and so unhelpful. I approach the take out section tonight. Several employees pass by me and no one greets me. The girl working the bartender has the nerve to squeeze by me without excusing herself so she can place something on the takeout counter. At this point I'm fed up so I finally decide to just leave but an employee (who has already passed by me several times) comes up to the counter and smiles at me but motions to the woman behind me because her order is ready. The woman steps in front of me and he proceeds to finish her transaction. HELLO!!! Did you not see me standing here for the past ten minutes?! Yes, you saw me but pretended not to. I would've been LESS upset if he would've acknowledged me at least once. No apology for the long wait. No hello. No good evening. I don't care how much I like the food here I will never return. Never ever again. I'm disgusted.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"They don't deserve any star! My husband and I visited this location on 10/25/16, ordered two pasta dishes and a dessert to celebrate my birthday. When we got home we found out that  the dessert was missing. I called the restaurant to inform them that something from my order was missing. Manager- Fatima promised me any 3 desserts on the menu my next time back. On 11/10/16 my husband and I decided to DINE IN and take our promised desserts to go. When we sat down we informed the waitress about this. She went to check with store manager then came back and said that we can have 2 desserts.Then we asked to speak to the manager. Manager- Amanda said that she can only give us 2 desserts. It wasn't about 2 or 3 desserts, a big chain restaurant like this can't even keep their word. It's very disappointing or very upsetting. I felt very bad for my husband, he had a busy day and was very hungry and we both took time and thought about what to order and even spend more than just claim our free desserts! We weren't there just for the free desserts, we were willing to sit down to eat but when all this happend we ended up leaving the restaurant instead unsatisfied and ill accomodated..",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I had a lot left over so I took it home and tried to give it another shot the next day and almost threw up after two bites.

Coming to this Olive Garden is either a hit or miss. I've been to this location about 6 times already and it's an okay place to go.

"This is one of the worst Olive Gardens I have ever been too!  When I go to the Olive Garden it is with a large team (party of 24), so with that being said I have gone to my fair share of Olive Gardens.  The service here was terrible.  We were seated at our table and no waiter/waitress came to take our drink order or food order for 15-20 minutes.  Then it took forever to get our drinks.  We weren't even done with our soup/salad and our dinners were brought out, which were sloppy and not even the same portion sizes that all other Olive Gardens offer.  Our group breaks up into smaller groups so that getting a table is easier. One of our other tables had one person that never got their food and the waitress had no idea.  Not to mention when drinks were brought to us she never gave us straws, never brought the bill over, and of course didn't give us the mints after dinner. You could hear everyone screwing around in the kitchen. All around just bad.

What truly made this visit 5 stars instead of 4 was the service. Jamil P was absolutely amazing. The restaurant was busy, but he made sure to give us his undivided attention and made us feel great as patrons. Simply put, he had absolutely amazing, positive, and high-energy. His positive demeanor and high energy made our two-hour visit memorable. A day later my date and I are still raving about Jamil's service.

"My husband and I just left the Olive Garden across from Queens Mall upset, We came in at 9:15 pm tonight into a 3/4th filled restaurant.The hostess, Natalia, said it would be a 15 minute wait even though there were visibly tons of empty tables.We get it.Manpower might have been low and she didn't want to slam the servers in the section.We ask to be placed on the list and she redirected us to the bar.We ask to be put on a list again and she says she will ""keep us in mind."" At this point two couples were ahead of us.Fine, we trusted that she knew the order of the folks waiting. 15 minutes go by,two men also want to be placed on the list that doesn't exist.Fine,as long as there is an understanding of the order of people waiting,we were fine. The two men went to another person Samantha.She immediately bypasses all the people who have been waiting patiently and seats them right away!we try to discuss this with her but she puts up her hand and sarcastically tells us ""oh well"" and walks away. I have never been treated with such absolute rudeness. All she had to do was redirect the men back to the hostess! We try to explain and are met blank stares and non responses. All of us waiting immediately walked out with our concerns unaddressed. A) I hope this Olive Garden hires a hostess who understands that taking names and not walking away from the hostess table are par for course in any restaurant. B) I hope Olive Garden hires servers who admit to their mistakes and not be rude to the other customers who were waiting patiently. One might be stressed out but the attitude is uncalled for. If you're in the wrong,don't make the customers waiting feel like it was their fault that you seated folks who came after. C) Today, Olive Garden lost two loyal Olive Garden customers.Breadsticks might be good but poor,rude,obnoxious,inefficient service supersedes unlimited breadsticks. UPDATE: We got a super quick and reassuring response from the general manager, Mr. Cunningham.Thank you for listening to our story and making every effort to make us feel like valuable customers!",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Not even breadsticks Decided to go Olive Garden after doing some shopping to see if I would have better luck with the wait time as I have tried to several times before but the waits have been outrageous. Finally got a table with no wait time today and that was the only positive thing that happened on this visit. Asked for a cocktail and a soda got a cocktail and a water tried to stop him but our server moe I believe his named was but he left to quick to get his attention. He came back several minutes later to ask I wanted salad and breadsticks. I waited 20 minutes and never got them finally I see him flag him down for our food I'm extremely disappointed on the service and just ask for the check he seem not to believe our request but after being there 30 minutes u become frustrated.

"The food here is average just chain Italian style food but you'll find at any other Olive Garden around the area.  The reason why I'm choosing to write a review for this specific location is is that it is relatively new and they are doing a really good job.  The staff here hustles-they're not lazy, they are very attentive and on top of the tables they are bussing.  We went in with a large group on a Saturday evening, they seated us right away and allowed us to wait with appetizers until the rest of our group was seated.  The service was prompt and friendly. This is in a prime location with a great parking lot to help in a very congested area by queens center mall.

"FEB 6th 2016: I came here for my son's 8th birthday and unfortunately service at this place is horrible! I literally just left this establishment and was there for a total of 3 hrs (we got there at 1:30 and it is now 4:30!) we had a party of 8. Majority of which were children. Took 45 mins just to get free breadsticks and salad alone! Patrons that arrived after us came and left even BEFORE we received any entrees. After complaining to the asst manager (Yian) we finally received our apps and entrees. We were informed because we had to wait so long for our food, dessert would be on the house, 2 of the 4 desserts came on time and the other 2 were completely forgotten about. After informing the asst mgr again that we didn't receive the rest of our desserts and were were ready to leave after being there for 3 hrs, I told him to pack the dessert but after another 10-15 mins we still did not receive our packed desserts. When our server finally came with a packed dessert, we found out it wasn't the dessert requested and had to wait again. All we got was 20% off for wasting our time and free dessert that wasn't delivered as promised. Never coming here again. I've managed a restaurant before so word of advice, get the kids fed so the parents aren't annoyed! Another word of advice, have your servers check in with customers so they know how long to expect their food. And finally, staff shouldn't argue in front of customers.  If you want to rectify the situation Olive Garden, you know how to contact me because you sure as hell can expect a 1 star Yelp review from my entire party.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"When we checked in, we were told it was a 20-25 minute wait and were given the round buzzing beeper thingie.  We went across the street to Modell's and then came back after 15 minutes or so.  We sat down in the bar area and waited, and waited.  During our wait time, I noticed that quite a few of the barstools under the 2 tables in the center had the plastic still attached to the brass spindles and the caulking above the wine rack above the bar was uneven and was showing a gap wide enough to see a few feet away.  Yes, I know I would only notice these minor details since I am a Project Manager by trade, but it clearly demonstrates a rush to open, unfortunately, sacrificing the attention to detail that should've been a priority.  Afterwards, no one caring enough to remove the plastic, which was now accumulating dust and sagging until it was hanging off.  It made me wonder how thoroughly  could the place actually be cleaned if no one noticed this at all. At around the 45 minute mark, we checked in with the front.  Apparently, they had not put my name into the system when we first arrived.  We would have waited indefinitely and no one cared.  I must say that we were seated next to rectify the mistake, but honestly, there should have been a discount or a free appetizer to truly make good. I was already annoyed, but wanted to keep an open mind.  My oldest daughter and I don't usually get to go on outings by ourselves, and I did not want to ruin the moment.  We were seated rapidly and handed a menu.  Our waitress, LaToya, seemed to be in a rush.  It didn't take too long to see why; she was waiting a lot of tables in that particular section.  Service was simply ok.  My drink ran out and the glass was not refilled.  After we finished with our salad plates, they were not removed until much later into the meal.  She did ask a few times as she zoomed by if we wanted anything else, but did not take the initiative to refill the drinks when they were really low. The food was also ok; nothing memorable.  The portion of rosemary garlic chicken was quite modest if you took the free salad and breadsticks out of the equation.  The Seafood Alfredo was a satisfying size. After about 5 minutes into the meal, another customer was seated behind us with her boyfriend.  She was uncomfortably pungent.  Her funk was overpowering the smell of the food and was making it hard to eat.  My daughter and I sneaked a couple of looks to gauge if maybe a homeless person had wandered in.  She did not appear to be homeless.  She was wearing expensive designer brands and her clothes were neat.  You could tells she spent money on her fake nails and really long braids, and did not have any visible stains on what she was wearing, but her body was just reeking nastily! We hurried through our meals because we couldn't stand smelling her any longer.  I realize it's not the restaurant's fault that their customers are particularly rank, but that, in conjunction with the indifferent service, dirty carpets with crumbs and litter all over the place if you cared to take a peek under your table, and so so food, made me feel I just wasted $50.  I definitely will not be returning to this Olive Garden!",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"The worst experience I have had at a restaurant in quite a while. It started as soon as I got there when the hostess would not take my name since the rest of my party was not there yet. But she told me to just let her know when the arrived and we would be seated right away. The restaurant was not too busy so I didn't fuss. When my family arrived the same hostess then told us it would be a 25 minute wait. After I complained she sat us at a booth for 4, we were a party of 5, with a chair added to the open end of the booth. We were seated in an entirely empty room where there were several larger tables available. There were also larger tables available in another room which was occupied.  I don't know about you, but I don't like being at the only occupied table Ina room because it almost always guaranteed poor service. I asked to be switched and was told I could not be because the table belonged to the server who was next up. I complained to the manager and was seated at a large table in the occupied room. The waitress came by fairly quickly and took our orders. My son drinks a lot of water so we asked for extra and she did bring him 2 glasses. Later in the meal she brought refills without asking for him and my husband, but ignored the empty water glasses in front of me and my daughter. Our meal was finished before we got our refills. The manager brought us salad and breadsticks shortly after our orders were taken so we wouldn't have to wait too long for food, which was nice. He did forget the cheese though, as did the waitress when she brought us a second salad bowl. I forgot about it too, but they are not supposed to. My son ordered soup instead of salad and when he later asked for salad, and my husband asked for soup, they were told that they could not get both. Maybe this is a new policy, but in the past it has been offered to us as an option. She finally did agree to bring them what they asked for. Finally, after quite a wait, considering it was now after 9 pm and the restaurant was more than half empty, our entrees arrived. No complaints about the taste of the food. However, my meal was supposed to come with spinach, but there was no sign of anything green on my plate. When I commented on it the waitress told me that they were out. No mention was made of it earlier, or even when she brought me the meal. Nor was any offer of a substitute made. I have never eaten at a restaurant that didn't inform me if they were out of something and a substitute offered. It will most likely be a long time, if ever, before I eat at this particular Olive Garden again. I have given the restaurant one star for the taste of the meal.

The food was good and our server was great. But let me tell you why I gave this place such a bad rating. While eating my food I looked to my right and noticed a couple dead dry roaches on the counter. This is disgusting! Not only did I see  dead roaches they also had Boric Acid spread around for the roaches. Looked like the roaches were having a cocaine party. Anyone that's familiar with Boric acid knows you shouldn't have it anywhere near where food is consumed or handled. I had already finished my plate when I noticed it. Or else I would've just walked out and left without paying. I really hope they take this seriously because that is a health hazard. And if they decided to add that to kill the roaches they should've had someone come really early to clean it before opening the establishment. Will def not come here ever again!

I came to this Olive Garden to celebrate my friends birthday. First off I was treated the way I would at a fast food restaurant. The waiter looked and acted like he was on drugs. He was shaky and weird and got our order completely wrong. While we were eating he asked us if we wanted the check twice. I felt like we were being rushed out. It was six people at my table and we only got the salad and soup once. I thought it was unlimited. He forgot my friends birthday conpletely and didnt even offer dessert. The drinksà were wrong the food was undercooked and I'm pretty sure my waiter was under the influence of drugs.

We were told it was going to be approximately 25-30 minute wait. 45 minutes later we finally got a table and was divided up by two servers, and still dont know why it was done that way. Both of them did not communicate with each other. we either got two of something or still waiting. The food was good but not worth the long wait. I wont be going here anytime soon until they can get it together. I know its a new establishment and has to work its kinks. I also dont advise to go here for a long wait if you have elderly people, not enough waiting room. alot of standing inside and outside.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"What can I say, an Olive Garden across QC mall. Real nice addition to the area. As I entered with my girlfriend, three females at the front desk, looked like chickens without heads and ignored us, I assure you we exist and lack invisibility powers. But after saying hi, they stopped and one of the three (assuming she's the manager) acknowledged us and gave us the wait coaster. We were told 15-20 minute wait. We waited. And waited. 15 minutes. 25 minutes. Anxiety. 30 minutes.  And finally got seated to our table. Our waiter was very friendly and informative. He suggested the best wines for our dinner. We chose moscato. The unlimited bread sticks and salad are amazing, my salad was a tad bit heavy on the oniony side. The breadsticks were warm and soft, yums with that three cheese dipping sauce,delish. The noise level here is quite loud, but that's due to the fact that it was a Sunday night,it was crowded with couples and families. The chicken and shrimp carbonara was real good, filling.  The wait for the food was average. I like the credit card digital pay yourself stations. If you're in a rush, you don't need to wait for the waiter or go up to the hostess,simply pay and go. That was pretty cool. Its a 3 star rating Olive Garden.",3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I've always been a fan of Olive Garden and I am happy that they opened up a location right here in Queens right next to Queens Center Mall which is only minutes away from where I live. The food here is pretty good but the dish that really stands out is the chicken and shrimp carbonara. It is very tasty and our server highly recommended it. As far as our server Jamal was concerned, he was very nice, friendly and has thorough knowledge of the whole menu top to bottom, left to right. However, the carpet needed some cleaning and vacuuming and some tables needed cleaning and/or setting up. We were seated at a table that was not set up yet. The salad came out first before the silverware lol This is why I deducted one star. Personally, I am very particular when it comes to cleanliness and very attentive to detail. I will definitely come back here from time to time and can't wait to try their other dishes.

"Finally got a chance to check out this new Olive Garden! Welcome to queens! I heard that this place gets busy so a group of us decided to come early for dinner. We came at around 4 and were seated promptly even though we were missing 2 more. Our waiter, Erikson came over right away and introduced himself and took our drink orders. Hubby ordered the margarita Italiano and he really liked it. So far so good.  Overall, the decor of the place is typical of any other Olive Garden. The parking lot is small, very limited, we were lucky to find a spot.  I heard that later on they will implement a parking metered system, but right now the meter machine is not working. The food was alright, my chicken and shrimp carbonara wasn't as tasty as the other olive gardens I've been to, it was missing something but I can't quite pin point what, it lacks a little more flavor. The breadsticks were great! Hot and toasty right out of the oven. The salad wasn't that crispy though. All the drinks we ordered were delicious! The service by our waiter was super great, he's very attentive, checking on us very often, making sure we are doing okay. In conclusion, service is good, needs a little more improvement on the food.",4.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This Olive Garden is terrible, 40 mins for drinks then another 20 for bread and salad. Everyone's food came out cold, my cousin asked for more salad and the server told her she should've went to a salad bar, so disrespectful. Never came back to check on the food. Finally my sister got up and asked for the check and when it was handed to her server told her tip was not included. Overall time in Olive Garden was 3 hours for food and soft drinks.

"The food is nothing spectacular here, but I'm still glad that an Olive Garden arrived in this neighborhood.  It's a good intermediate Italian option that families can go to without breaking the bank at a overly extravagant Italian restaurant.  Besides, the selection is large enough for everyone to find something they like.  Plus, you can't beat the unlimited soup/salad and breadsticks they serve with almost any entree.  Olive Garden has tried to step it up its ambiance by shedding it's ""fast food Italian"" reputation similar to what Ruby Tuesday did with American.  This location is right next to Queens Center Mall and makes for a good meal after shopping.",3.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I rarely give bad reviews but this place is atrocious. First, although our waitress mardaly seemed nice, she totally scammed us when she took our order. Whyyyyy were we charged $4 for dipping sauce and $6 for two Caesars???? She never mentioned anything about the additional price. All she said was that our breadsticks now come with a dipping sauce. And that our meal came with a house salad or Caesar. Second, my bf had the Steak Gorgonzola and it had a seafoody aftertaste. Wtf man?! Are you guys using the same freaken pan to cook everything in without washing it?? Couldn't even finish it bc he was scared of getting food poisoning. And third, the whole using the tablet really sucks. Our waitress gave herself a 20% tip. Like who does that? She didn't deserve it especially when at first, they gave us only one Caesar salad and there was absolutely no croutons in it. I will never come here again.

"Not too happy. Won't be going back to this location. A small group of friends and myself came here for a holiday work party. We made reservations two days prior and still had to wait 15/20 min to be seated. Once we were seated it took another 8/10 min for a waiter to approach us about drinks. We were ready to order by that time. Our food came out before our drinks did. 2 orders were sent back due to our waitress making a mistake when she took the order. The 2 meals came out as the rest of us were finishing up. Not good. We then asked for the desert menu, which we are still waiting for 3 days later. We work in the area and often get together. We are not to fond of going back there..",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"The food is bland. It seems like the food was frozen then microwaved. The chefs are obviously inexperienced. The chicken was over fried. The tomato sauce was plain, brand named tomato sauce tastes better. The only good food was the breadsticks. The staff was nice and friendly however inexperienced. I asked for napkins three times during the meal and she forgot each time. By the time we finished our meal, we asked for the check because the waiter was never going to give us napkins. And the bill was expensive for a crappy meal. I won't be coming here again. I would rather go to a restaurant owned by a person instead of a chained restaurant.

"First let me say that I walk with a cane and a ""senior"". It is lunchtime and after a few hours of shopping decided to have what we thought would be a light lunch.  It turned into a ""heavy meal"", as my friend  said.  Entering from the parking lot I found myself in what looks like their lounge area.  It is also the entrance if you want something ""to go"". The person behind the counter does not acknowledge my presence....like asking if I am looking to get a table.  There is someone at the bar....she says nothing.  I noticed that there were tables in this area and people were eating.  Looking further I saw someone in front of a podium and concluded that it must be the host.  I hobbled over waiting for my irend to enter as she was still parking the car.   As she approached I told the host that there would be two people.  She conferred with the person doing the seating.   ""Follow me"", she said.  We walked passed one room into the next and noticed that there was an open table right there.  However, the ""seater"" continued up the aisle to a much further table. ""Can't we have this table?"" I asked.  She came back by telling me that she was seating me there so that I could be closer to the restroom since I was walking with a cane.   Where she was seating us was further from the restroom but I couldn't help but come back with ""Do you think that because I have a cane that I automatically need to pee?"" The reality was that none of these people gave a flying chick about my disability.  It was about who waits on what table.  In fact, when my waitperson came over I asked what her ""territory"" was and did not include the table in ""Canarsie"". We each ordered the ""quick lunch"" of the all-you-can eat soup, salad and bread sticks.  Salad comes out.  It consists of iceberg lettuce (the cheapest and least nutritious possible) along with plenty of sliced red onions, a pinch of red cabbage, two olives and two thin slices of tomato.   Wait for it....wait for it. They only allow one slice of tomato and one olive per person unless you ask.   When we requested the second bowl of salad, we requested extra tomato and black olives (you know...that canned stuff).  This time there was a total of two slices of tomato for each and two olives for each.   Picture a group of people at a table with a bowl of salad.   Does that conversation have to turn to being diplomatic and making sure that no one gets more than their share? It doesn't end here.  Wait for it....wait for it.   I had ordered chicken soup with gnocci.  That seemed to be okay.  My friend first orders a different soup but also decided to have a second one of the c with g and I ordered a refill.  Both bowls arrived minus the gnocci.   Yes, there were apologies from the kitchen manager and the food manager.  I mean, how to you serve a simple soup without one of the main ingredients? Where is Gordon Ramsay when you need him? Visit to the ladies room.   One stall had no toilet paper despite there being a dispenser that holds two.  No paper seat covers either.  Thank goodness I was able to get the ""wipes"" hanging down from the stall abutting. Back to the table to hear the person seated just across from me complaining about something.  I had to ask.  Her salad arrived with the core of the lettuce and brown.   The part that was supposed to be thrown away was dumped into the salad. As for the food...it's one above fast food. Here is the killer.  As we were leaving the restaurant via the same entrance we came into I notice that there was a restroom right there designated for handicapped people!",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"My mother and I recently had dinner here for her birthday. Olive Garden was my favorite restaurant until now. Our waiter's name was ""Melo"", and I did not get a good impression from him from the moment he introduced himself. He was cold and impersonal.  He forgot my water and our bread, and my mother's drink order was wrong. Rather than apologizing, he insisted that SHE was wrong, and although my mother wasnt happy with her new drink after he got her another, she told him it was ok to avoid more arguing. He was rushing and seemed to be extremely upset. I ordered a frozen margarita which tasted like pure salt and ice, and was completely watered down. Our salad was dry and salty, and after I asked for a little dressing on the side, we got a plate of EXTREMELY salty dressing. When I mentioned we didn't get any bread, Melo again did NOT apologize or seemed sorry in the least, and the bread we got was again SALTY as hell, not too mention greasy too. Our food was just ok, and in the end my mother was still going to tip Melo but then changed her mind due to the horrible service (and not being able to find him) and just left him nothing. This restaurant should really change its name to Salt Garden, and we will not be visiting again any time soon.",1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"After being out of work for 2 years and finally landing a job, I promised my family that we would go out to dinner with my first paycheck. Options were, Ale House, Joe's Crab Shack or Olive Garden since they were all in walking distance. Family went with Olive Garden and what a huge disappointment and waste of my hard earned money. I would have felt better giving it to someone in need. Now the place was not even crowded on a Tuesday night, but we sat endlessly right off the back for nearly 20 minutes, with no one stopping by, no server or anyone. Growing impatient and starving, we were all set to walk out and go to Joe's when our waitress finally decided to make an appearance.  She asked if we needed more time and we said no, really wanting to tell her that we had been waiting forever already, so immediately placed appetizer, dinner and drink orders, including coffee. We brought the drinks and coffee, but did not bring, a spoon, milk or sugar for the coffee and poof, she disappeared! We sat and sat and sat, just looking at each other and the black coffee which became the top of conversation. We sat so long the coffee was bound to be cold. Finally, the host walked by and we explained to him that the waitress gave us coffee but she did not gave her with any sugar, nor spoon or milk. What does the host do....he goes and give her milk, still no spoon or sugar....we asked him where were the other items and he returned with sugar each (1) regular (1) equal and (1) sweet n low (rationing) and he really thought he did something great, by the way he handed to her. We just looked like really?!, Still no spoon and no waitress, so she stirred the coffee with her fork.  Finally, the waitress returned and we informed her that we waited so long that the coffee was now cold. She went to get another one and we adding the milk and sugar, only to find out it was water-like so we did not want either and sat it on the edge of the table. We again sat and sat and sat and only to see the waitress having a laugh fest with a co-worker as she strolled past us like were were invisible. Annoyed, I stopped her in her tracts and stated that we needed her. Guess she forgot about us. Again, we sat and sat and finally, the appetizer, soup and salad which was fine. Once our food arrived, it was nearly dried pasta, not hot, all 4 entrees, looked less than pleasing, nothing was hot. Just totally annoyed, as hungry as were were, no one ate their food, we just looked at it, not what we expected it to look like. The only thing that was good was the appetizer and the pina cola (virgin). My husband continually made excuses for the waitress, but I have zero tolerance because I am spending money that I just earned from a new job and it was not easy to find a new job and to waste it on a unfit dinner.  My family said they know that I had good intentions to celebrate and they were sorry but it was not good and we should have went to Joe's. I agreed. My husband even asked her a question about his meal and we just sat there and listen and then concluded, that she knew nothing about what she was talking about, just rambling. We just shook our heads. Before we could even get out of that place, we had all updated out Facebook status with ""Worst Place Ever - Oliver Garden - Queens Boulevard"" Never Again.... Just the mere thought of ever going there again, ain't happening.  My daughter did not want me to leave a tip but I did and I should not have. This girl was the worst, the service was, the worst, the food was the worst and the parking was the worst.  Worst celebration ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Came here after seeing never ending pasta commercial.  I don't come here often so didn't really know what to expect.  First there was no menu for never ending pasta on the table, had to ask for one, and waitress was kind of rude.  Then after ordering she wanted the menu back.  I said no I'll keep that, since it's ""never ending"" and I was going to try all their pastas or as many as I could.  I mean, that's why I came, and if I found a great pasta maybe I'd come again. So I eat only half the fettucine alfredo, to save room, and order something else.  She asks ""you didn't like it?"", like she has a problem with me ordering another.  I say no, she gets me another.  I say can I get smaller portions, 'cause I want to try different pastas.  She says I have to talk to the manager.  Manager comes over.  I say ""what's the problem, is this not never ending pasta?""  He says ""It's never ending for only one dish, you can't keep ordering different pastas"".  I say okay.  Then I look at the menu again and it says this:  ""Enjoy never ending combinations of your favorite pastas, sauces and toppings"".  So the manager was just making stuff up.  No wonder they tried to take away the menu.  Waitress comes back, I tell her ""manager said only one kind of pasta but menu says enjoy never ending COMBINATIONS"".  She says ""yeah, but you have to finish it, we don't want to throw away food"".  First of all, that's why I asked for SMALLER PORTIONS to begin with.  Second of all, this is now a different story than the one the manager had.  And neither of these stories are in writing on the menu.  So, in summary, this place just doesn't have it's act together.  OR, they simply keep it vague on purpose, because they know there's a catch which is not advertised.  The catch being -- if you want to try different ""combinations"", as advertised, you have to be a 600 pound sumo wrestler, not advertised, because you have to finish EVERYTHING.  Anyway, their ""Never Ending"" pasta is just to get you in the door.  It's bull, just so you know.  Food is meh, service is meh, unaccommodating, searching for excuses to short change you.  I came here once last year and found a plastic string in my food, and also unprofessional service.  Only thing I can say in favor, it was cheap, just don't let them push the booze on you.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

The food is what was to be expected of Olive Garden and needless to say I had a very good experience here and will definitely be coming here again.,5.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"There are plenty of nice restaurants to go to and spend your hard earned dollars than this place. I went there on 2 occasions because some of the people I know like franchises, this includes Olive Garden. Till today, I wonder why.  Both times were mediocre at best! They aren't even trying. The place is uncleaned and poorly managed. We stared at uncleaned tables for the duration of our meal with neither of the workers and managers passing by giving a F***. Food was Meh. Bread sticks too oily, and needless to say we got them after we were done with our starters because supposedly a table ordered all the bread sticks this place served lol and new ones had to be made. The Soup tasted canned, the salad unappealing, Entrées were  too salty or too oily. The herb-salmon I had, was overcooked, under-seasoned and small but HEY they gave me a plantation of broccolis to go with. This place is horrible!

"They should be ashamed to have the Olive Garden name on this restaurant.  Have been there a few times but front desk and servers are not pleasant.  Today girl got upset at us saying she did not know we had 8 in our party instead of 5.  I insisted we told them from the beginning.  They never wrote down our name nor gave us one of those things that beep when it's our turn.  We had to ask for a server to come to our table.  Even though they have gluten sensitive items on menu, I was told there was no pasta.  I was brought another gluten menu and asked for a salad which they then said they didn't have either and that menu was outdated.  I then said it was ok I would just share the unlimited salad with the rest of my party.  At the end of the meal, they tacked on a garden salad costing $4.49 on my bill saying it was because I didn't have an entree.  I asked for manager who removed it after my explanation that I had only had a small plate of salad and nothing else, not a whole garden salad for myself.  We had to ask for water a number of times, even the bill which took a very long time. Previous time I came waiter was tired from closing night before and coming in early that day and kept forgetting everything in entree and salad.  I don't think I'll be back for a loooooong time here.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
By far one of the worse dining experiences I have ever had in my life. I ordered the Northern Tour of Italy and for some reason none of the waiters wanted to let me know it was not available. Sat at Olive Garden for 30 minutes waiting for my food and when I asked why it was taking so long my server checked on my food and told me it was on its way. After another hour of waiting they finally told me they were never preparing it and they could not make it for today.,1.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Opening day to the public was yesterday.  Stumbled upon it with some friends, 20 min wait and we were in.  I understand it was opening day, which is fine.  Things don't go smoothly.  It took at least 10 mins before a waiter came to us.  Two of my friends ordered drinks.  Three of us got the unlimited bread sticks and salad and one soup.  The bread sticks and salad came, the soup never came.  The entrees came, one of them forgot to put chicken on it which happened to be the same one that we found hair.  Makes things worse is that at this point only one of the drinks came.  Another waiter came to give us some parm cheese on the pasta and left after only serving half of us.  We had to ask someone else later for cheese.  Our waiter came by and we informed her that one of the dishes was missing the chicken, another person was never brought their soup and we were missing a drink.  She said she would figure it out and a manager would speak to us.  A manager finally came and said the missing drink would be on the house and behold, our check does not reflect that.  We told a waiter and we finally got it sorted out.  However, it seems we had to get at least 5 staff to help us out the entire night.  Poor service, they need more organization.  I understand it's opening day and I am willing to give them another shot.",2.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Lovvvveeeee it here. I tried Olive Garden out for the first time with my family and we were pleasantly surprised. After hearing not so great things about the one at this location, we were a little skeptical to go in. But my sister insisted. We were a party of four and got seated right away (it was 2 PM on a SUNDAY afternoon). My mom and aunt were offered complimentary wine taste (they loved it). And we ordered our food. EVERYTHING was great. From the salad to the breadsticks to the bolognese to the salmon. I like that now they have these little tablets where you can order drinks, appetizers and desserts; you can play games (but before playing be warned: they charge you like $1.99 per different game), and you can pay your bill! I thought that was the coolest thing ever. It shows everything you ordered and it gives you the option to split the bill and control how much tip you want to give. AND you get your receipt right there! I'm a technology junkie if you can't tell. All in all it was a great experience and we will definitely be going back.",5.0,"92-10 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Last night we were a table of 6. We are seated right away at a 4 top, with a chair at the end. I look at the host and remind him that we are a table of 6. He says that he knows, he will put an extra chair at (already crowded) table. I turn and look, half the restaurant was empty (it's a pretty large restaurant, which is great). So we said this whole section has tables open, there is no way we can get two tables pushed together? Finally he says yeah I guess so and he does that. Another server walks over and asks him who told him to seat here, the host says we insisted (uh, yeah, cause we aren't sitting at a 4 top!). It just made me really uncomfortable, and I honestly felt like getting up and walking out.  After that, our evening turned around Lebron was our server, he was fantastic and super nice, and we had a nice dinner.

Good thing the other members are there while my Dad and I are looking for parking (one of the cons! Hence less 1 star) But our waitress was phenomenal. Given that our party took forever to order (we got some oldies and toddlers that I had to explain and change orders) but she was so patient, smiling the entire time, very courteous and thanks us when we thank her and always makes sure everybody gets their drinks and orders. She even informed us that she'll be gone for a bit to head to the kitchen. Sure she left a coffee or two but she was apologetic and rectified the issue.

He was helpful, pleasant and moved fast and really made the experience worth coming for a second time. The food was regular and the margarita was very weak but tasty. The salad was great, the bread was great and the entree was okay. The food came fast and was very hot so that's a good thing. So the 2nd time I went on a Sunday, the wait was about 45 minutes. Once we was seated our waiter took forever to take our order. They finally took our order 30 minutes later and then waited about 25-30 minutes for our food (I wasn't too upset because it was busy) By the time the food came we had already ate all the salad and had tons of bread that we hardly could eat our meal so we ended up taking most of it to go.

She argues that the size cup is the same when it's obvious is not. I send it back and she brings it back with regular salt. No where close to how it's suppose to come. So the manager approaches me and Indeed agrees that the size of the cup is much smaller and apologize. He was nice enough to go check if they had sugar and offered to remove the drink off my check for the inconvenience. However talk about a waiter will say anything.

"So I've never been a fan of Olive Garden but since one was just built around the block, we thought to go check it out n show some support. I was also hoping my experience here would change my opinion. Since I live walking distance from the restaurant I was also hoping I could include this restaurant as a go to place for me n my family. I ordered the lasagna primavera lasagna (lighter menu option) stuffed with cheese and veggies n topped w chicken. I wanted the regular lasagna then was advised there is pork in it so that was not an option. Of course my meal was smothered in pork and I ate it unknowingly thinking I was eating the healthy item on the menu. I haven't eaten pork in over 6 years which was a huge disappointment to me. Also the Sangria tasted like wine and juice mixed together..no fruit inside just topped with a lime, strawberry and cherries.  The Long Island ice tea was also terrible! Although the restaurant was a full house they still have to deliver quality, they just lost two local customers. Olive Garden is no competition with their neighbor Longhorns.

The asiago garlic sauce was bland (way blander than any OG I've had it at before). The breadsticks were overcooked. The salad was mostly croutons and cabbage. No cheese was offered. The bartender Isaiah was very nice and efficient. It seems like there are regulars here which was sweet and funny. The bar plays sports as well as something else (this time it was the Apollo Theater's show with Steve Harvey).

We arrived and was seated in under 10 minutes, I don't do long waits, crowds or drama as I've got enough of that on the daily. We absolutely loved our dining experience @ Olive Garden. Shout out to our awesome server Isaiah for the evening. If you can, do ask for this mild mannered but very on point gentleman who is well versed on the menu and exemplifies the true meaning of hospitality. We've been longtime fans of Olive Garden from its inception with a deep appreciation for Italian food. Some of you may balk at our love for Olive Garden and that's fine, move on if it isn't your thing. My mom who is the core of my being was very pleased with both Isaiah as our server, decor, layout & the food (wow factor)! The food... Jesus Christ look at the photos! We had the famous House salad don't pass go, just get it, comes with all the right fixings. The breadsticks... perfectly salted & buttered and easily goes with dipping sauce served with none other than marinara or you choose... The Italian sampler... who doesn't love a Great Italian sampler (you've got options) we chose the trio with stuffed mushrooms, calamari & toasted beef ravioli's. Fantabulous (is that word a word) it is now!! My mom had her tastebuds set on a simple pasta dish (spaghetti) with meat sauce marinara and chose those great big meatballs (3) with shrimp (10) as add on's. Sheer joy for her for both taste factor & portion sizes, a hit! I'm happy because she's happy! Other people in our dining party chose signature dishes such as Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo & I and old favorite Chicken Marsala. Solid choices, Flavor packed, rich and delicious. The chicken app my mom had (can't remember the name) check photo was shockingly delicious. My mom has got 3 eyes on us so we had a few of their oversized Sangarita's that's in moderation for me but whoa gotta thank Isaiah these babies were Excellent drinks and perfectly balanced with strength.  Do try one for yourself. The dessert's as you can imagine we were too stuffed to eat in but we ordered the lemon cream cake & Black Tie Mousse cake (moist, deep, dark decadent, rich and creamy chocolate) surpasses all desserts for me.

"It's a pleasant restaurant that just opened last Tuesday. The logistic of running such a large area is missing. They have a wasteful and ineficiente system in place. We asked for water as we were seated. It took a while to get water. It's cold in NYC. The tall glasses were filled with ice and little water. When we asked for more water rather than refilling the glasses they were taken away. Waiting for water. The waiter told us they did not have clean glasses that is what caused the delay. Finally, the replacement water glasses came. More straws were distributed. Wasteful! What happened to having a busboy to serve water, retired the dishes, clean tables, etc. Someone does not know how to run a restaurant. Every single table complained about service delays. We ordered our food and a pitcher of Peach Sangria. Appetizers, salad & bread came. The salad was just lettuce. I did not see anything else on it. The food was good. The Sangria never came. So we told the waiter to cancel it. Then, a pitcher was sent ""complimentary"" with the excuse that they just opened the establishment and were not prepared for volume. How could you open a restaurant and not have the training in place and personnel to service the customers? Very bad start. To add insult to injury, extra charges were added to our bill. When we showed the bill to our waitress she realized that the table next to us was added to our bill. She had to tell someone by the register to re-do the bills. If they don't improve they will not survive. Poor planning and execution.",2.0,"100 W 125th St, New York, NY 10027",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"What a crap show! Me and my friend went to have dinner there but we were not successful first they seated us and then when they seated us we was seated for 30 minutes no one came to service us. I was very thirsty and I had to pull some waitress from the other side of the room so that she can give us water. I asked to speak with the manager the manager took my order because the waitresses were not available however he really didn't take my order, he disappeared too. They left the sitting there for another 15 minutes which made it 45 minutes then they never they never brought us our bread and our salad it was just a very horrible experience and finally a waitress came with a couple of entrees and put it on the table for us and it wasn't even ours because of course we never placed orders so they gave they gave somebody else's they serve the somebody else's food then they couldn't figure out who the food belong to so needless to say it was just a horrible experience and we just had to leave and find another place to eat cuz by then we were just starving bad bad service.

"I went here yesterday, with a party of 3. We had to wait at least 20-30 minutes just to be seated. I was hesitant at first to wait to be seated and there seemed to be a lot of people to be waiting. I asked the host and the host explained how long it would be. We all decided to wait since it would be the first time eating at Olive Garden. However, I had to go back to the hostess just so she could write my name down on the list, which is obvious that you were supposed to do that in the first place. Secure your customers! Just saying. Anyway, we didn't mind waiting since we have phones now. After we were seated, it seemed the place was very clean, and people were very friendly. It was a nice ambience with a live band playing. It felt really fancy. We had our server Crystal B. She was wonderful. I really loved how attentive she was and she made sure to not forget us. She also has a sense of good humor. The food was pretty good to everyone else in my party and myself included. We did wait a couple of minutes for everything but it didn't matter because we all enjoyed each others companies. These were expensive plates, averaging $16-$20 plates. But the customer service and ambiance was great that I just decided to let it be. Crystal B. Offered us moscato and it was lovely, she brought our drinks and salad (salad and bread was really good) in a timely manner and offered and accommodated us in everything we asked. These guys on the floor yesterday from 5-6 pm were pretty good and shout out to the chef, and prep cooks. Its not easy being in a kitchen. Very much appreciated.

I ordered take out yesterday hmmm to start I ordered fettuccine Alfredo with a 6 oz steak on the side along with spaghetti and meatballs and a house salad. Now when packaging the food for delivery I would expect the steak to be separated so it wouldn't mess up the fettuccine but obviously I took a food handlers course and no one at this establishment has even taken any kind of training course .

"Listen...Absolutely not. Dishes were dirty...like super dirty. I mean pieces of food were still lodged in the spokes of the forks. THREE DIFFERENT FORKS. I eventually asked for plasticware. There are these little machines on the bar and at the tables where you enter your order and I suppose it should theoretically just come to you after that. The system doesn't seem to work, though because I still had to reference a regular menu and place an order after entering something on the screen. My friend and I ordered soup and lasagna. The soup came out literally after we were finished eating, and that was supposed to be the appetizer or something. The salad came after the soup. We didn't get any bread at all. My wine glass literally had pink lip stick and the print of someone's lips on it. I asked for a clean glass. The bartender wet a glass and gave it back to me with water dripping off of it. I had to dry the glass with my napkin. I could've sworn this place had a grand opening sign up, and we were there at a random time of day when it wasn't crowded at all, so I'm not quite understanding what the problem was. I won't give them another chance, but I wouldn't discourage anyone else from trying it out. Seems like it has potential and my wine was pretty good.

"Food is ok. It looks like a high end place, but customer service definitely is not. Wait time for a table is too long even with lots of tables empty. There are not many other options for sit down restaurants in that neighborhood so me and my friends went there a few times always having a similar experience: When we ordered drinks, they only came after we were finished eating. Not good. Usually a drink is to be served as an appetizer or no later than along with the food. They never ask if you like more than one serving of the ""never ending salad"". They bring the salad and forget the cheese. You can expect to never get the cheese or having to get up and look for someone to ask for the cheese. They hide the specials and only give out the regular menu. If we hadn't looked them up online they would have not told us about them. They play their music night time nightclub loud in the middle of the day when people may dine in for a business lunch needing to hear each other talk. I don't know about other Olive gardens, but this one serves espresso in a large coffee cup. It looks like the cup is just dirty with some dark water on the bottom plus it gets cold quick that way. There is a reason why espressos are normally served in small espresso cups. Serving espresso in a large cup is a stupid way of Americanizing espresso...They repeatedly over charge a few dollars.

"First, let me start my review by saying that I am not a big fan of Olive Garden, never been, but, because I was hungry and was running some errands in Harlem and not other ""decent"" place around this area to grab a bite, Olive Garden was my only option. The service here is NOT A+.  I supposed to be seated by one of the servers or waiters, but they were too busy chatting among themselves in the main entrance of the restaurant that I walked in and I picked a table all by myself. After may be 10 minutes sitting down waiters come and go around my table and none acknowledged me, so I raised my arm in signal that I needed service, one employee named Fatima, came to me and asked me who was my waiter, I told her that I didn't have none, she apologized and went to find a server, she came back to me and apologized again, then she asked me if I wanted to have something to drink or eat something as starter while the server take my order, I ordered a Blackberry Sparkling Soda and a Minestrone Soup. I'd really liked the attitude of this girl; she was very professional and kind. She really cared and was concerned about the situation. After a few minutes she brought me the soup and the water. Then, minutes later, another employee, a girl named Maria and another one came to me and, she told me that I'm not suppose to be sitting in that table because "" the table it was a pick up"". I was confused, looking them; I asked her, ""Do you want me to go to another table?"" And she said, ""No stay there, you are already sit down"", this girl Maria had a little attitude and I didn't like it, it was very unpleasant situation. Now let's go to the food. The minestrone was O.K, nothing special, it tasted more like a Campbell Soup. After the soup, I ordered Lobster Ravioli and honestly, it was BAD, the sauce was extremely salty and greasy, if I suffered of High Blood pressure or High Cholesterol, I will die in the spot, terrible taste, but, I was hungry, so, after finish my lunch I asked for the bill and the ""waiter"" asked me to swipe my card in one of the devices that it was on the table, so, I did it, honestly I didn't want to tip them, except for Fatima that really cared about me, but the freaking device was forcing me to leave a tip, not what I want, instead what they ""suggested"", I think that when you go to Restaurant, you tip the waiter based in their service, NONE can force you to leave a tip, if the waiter ignore you, give you attitude or simply, don't care. In the future, if I'm on the road and need to put something in my stomach and I see an Olive Garden Restaurant and a Hot Dog vendor. I will choose the Hot Dog over Olive Garden....",1.0,"100 W 125th St, New York, NY 10027",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

When the order was taken the food came out cold and no silverware. I had to go into the kitchen and get silverware for my table. No one consistently checked on us; however the waitress was kind just not attentive. It is really unfortunate to see such poor service, and the worst part was when they wanted us to leave instead of saying ""We are closed"" they turned out all the lights and started yelling ""You ain't got to go home, but get the hell out of here.""

"Part One: I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty my dinner meal was. We had the Calamari for the appetizer and fired as it was it flouted in our mouths. For my main course, I ate the Steak and Lobster Ravioli (Me wants Tartar Sauce for my Fried Calamari) that was swimming in delicious cheese sauce. And you can taste the actually lobster meat. Cousin Kyndell equally enjoyed her Shrimp Pasta Primavera. The top notch professional waitress who put up with my stupid jokes with a winning smile sang and brought me a cheesecake pie to take home along with a large portion of salad and bread. I brought the cake home and even though I ain't supposed to eat sweets I got weak and it tasted like Heaven. It tasted better than all that Italian food they were feeding us in Old Italy. Part Two: I went back to the 125th Street Harlem Olive Garden and the food was just as good. I had the Lobster Ravioli with the cheese sauce and the Steak but this time I added the Shrimps. Wonderful taste. The service was great with the Hostess with the Mostess Sade and our server man Walter who was indeed a gentleman with just a hint of the uptown Royal touch. In other words, I totally dug my second food experience there. One Complaint: We in Harlem want Tartar Sauce for our Fried Calamari Appetizers.

"Am I at Olive Garden?! I mean, the layout of the entire restaurant is totally different from the ones I have been to.

From the moment I came up the escalator, I was greeted by amazing smiles. The service was prompt and fast. I didn't have to wait for anything. Everyone was so happy and it rubbed off on me that day too! I didn't have an empty glass, nor were there empty plates on my table. They took it away immediately! Of all Olive Gardens I have been to, this has to be my favorite one by far. Food was good; it definitely made my tummy happy. Start off with the Lasagna Fritta!

"We came here with a big hunger and as we know Olive Garden from downtown we decided to eat here. First impression was okay with the wine display etc. but the further we got we saw the uncleared tables and that already raised a red flag. Once we were seated our waiter brought us the salad and bread sticks and told us that he is sorry but they ran out of silver cutlery as they weren't done washing them yet and asked if it's okay to give us plastic cutlery. I was kind of flabbergasted because I travelled the whole world and have never encountered a situation like this. We we said okay and tried to ignore it. We already had 2 salad bowls when the food arrived approx 35 minutes later. You can imagine that we were almost full. Anyways my two friends ordered the steak with zucchini and pasta and instead of zucchinis they got mashed potatoes with pasta and steak. Now this is a culinary disaster. Mashed potatoes with Alfredo pasta. A combination any chef should know should does not go together. When we asked the other waiter who suddenly started to serve our table (very nice girl btw, her name is Ana) she said that the kitchen ran out of zucchini's. So now wouldn't it be appropriate to ask if the customer if we would be okay with the mashed potatoes instead of zucchinis? When I brought this up Ana of course tried to defend her colleague and told us that even he might not have know that they ran out and apologized and asked my friends if they would like to have some spinach with it. We said okay and they got some spinach. Then when we are paying the bill on that our actual waiter showed up and tried to help me to pay our bill with my card on that little screen. When it came to the tip he told me here you can chose what tip you wish to leave and was standing over my head with his face in the screen so as polite I am I could not even change my tip amount as it was already preset to 20%. I didn't think that they deserved this at all with the lack of knowledge of what they ran out of, like silver cutlery and zucchinis etc. the restaurant tables were not cleared up in a timely manner so I can understand why there were no cutleries. The manager came by with a big smile in her face telling us that she hoped we enjoyed the dinner and gave us some $10 discount cards for next month.

If I could give 0 stars I would. We had to wait over 30 minutes until someone even felt responsible to take our order (we had to ask for someone to come). It then took over 20 minutes to get our drinks - during this waiting time we were offered to taste some wine (a sip) which they charged us as a whole glass in the end. The food took even longer.

"I have been there three times, all for lunch. I work in the area. 1) not busy. Hostess suggested we sit at the bar since it would be faster. Unclear why she suggested that but we went to the bar. Since it's lunch you think they would understand and try to move things faster. Nothing. Bartender was good. Asked about our food. Decent service. Only issue we had was that she threw out the bread before we finished. She stated she would give us some to go and never did it. 2) sat at a table. 7-8 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Only like 10-11 tables in total in entire restaurant. I counted 4 waiters and two managers. Specifically told waiter we wanted a beer to drink as we waited for the food. Beer arrived with food. Beer was hot. Seems like bartender poured the beer but the waiter never got it. Asked for a replacement on the beers. We continued to eat. Beers arrived as we had one-two bites left on the food. Now beers arrived cold. At that point we didn't want the beers and only took a few sips. That was about $12 down the drain. In hindsight we shoulda just cancelled the beers. 3) went with brother who was in the area shopping. Once again restaurant has about 11-12 tables (out of about 40+). 4 waiters. 2 hostess. 1 bartender. I think 2 managers. Waited like 8 minutes to be noticed. Order was taken. Food arrived soon after. I asked waitress for paper napkins 4 times before she finally brought them. She continued to forget because she was talking to nearby table about ""head shots"", ""producing commercials"", ""writing a pilot"".  Seems like she was an actress and the person at the table was some TV or movie guy. She spent too much time at that table and it caused an issue with her service. To sum it all up, I would not return for lunch again. My work lunch is one hour and they don't seem think about that. There is no sense of urgency to get you in and out as soon as possible. DON'T GO FOR LUNCH!! If I ever go for happy hour or dinner I will give my feedback.

And the restaurant was pretty clean. The not so good- We waited a long time to be seated... Apparently the host staff has a problem counting. My step-dad said party of 4... After waiting like 20 minutes and other parties being sat in front of us who arrived after us, someone asked if the rest of party had arrived yet... Um yes, we had all 4 been there the entire time. They did bring out the wrong dish for one of us--- but our waiter made sure that this was promptly addressed and taken care of... Wait times at times were a bit long, but I know part of this was due to my aunts indecisiveness... They may be able to benefit from a slightly bigger wait-staff though... Our waiter seemed to handle it well though. Anyway- I know they're new... I'll give them another try when I come visit my aunt again in the spring.

"My mother and I decided to try this location since our favorite one on 22nd street and 6th avenue closed its doors some months ago.  When we got here we were told we would have to wait about 5 minutes for a table which was fine.  When we were seated, I noticed that there were quite a few tables vacant where we and another couple could've sat.  We were told our server would be with us shortly.  The place wasn't crowded so I couldn't understand why we waited more than 10 minutes for a server.  I don't know if this is something new with the chain but they now have a kiosk tablet (for lack of a better term) on each table.  It has games, news and you can call your server over which is what we did.  The person who seated us came over and apologized for the delay and took our order.  We had mozzarella sticks that were no hot enough for the cheese to be gooey once bitten into.  The soup and salad should've been bought out first. But instead everything was bought together.  The food was ok.  Usually at Olive Garden, they offer you a sample of their wine.  We had to ask for that.  When getting ready to leave, we had to wait to get cartons to take our lefterovers, to get the check and to get our change.  The atmosphere did not have a ""welcome to our home"" type feel like the other location I mentioned before.  We did not feel comfortable there.  There were one or two children out of their seats and causing some noise disturbances.  But no one said anything to rectify the situation. Bottom line, we were unhappy with the restaurant and the service and will most likely not be visiting again.",1.0,"100 W 125th St, New York, NY 10027",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Been here twice since they've opened which was recently I'm glad they did. Both visits were very pleasant and the servers were great!!! First visit I had the make your own pasta which was simply ok; but the soup I had was delicious kinda like a creamy chicken soup yummy. Breadsticks were hot out the oven also they were giving out complimentary wine tastings I liked the red over moscato. This visit today I had the lobster ravioli when it came to my table was surprised there was jumbo shrimp on top heaven; also had a coupon for a free dessert or appetizer which the waitress had no problem dealing with I had the lemon cake light airy & fluffy.

So I asked to get some salad to go ( which I have got other times I was there ) it actually comes packed up and ready to go so I don't see any reason why they didn't have any salad to go.

It was also a pleasant surprise to get free samples of moscato with our meal. Our server was super helpful and cordial the entire time.

Our server came took our order and we waited for the main course for over an hour.

We asked for some desert items but they ran out of them all except these little cheesecake cups. This is the worst part. Their card machines went down and asked everyone to wait an additional 30-40 minutes if you did not have cash. I literally felt like I was being held captive.

"It's serious when I have to come to Yelp to WARN others.  Not that I'm going to say anything several others before me have not said, but I have to share, that from the first bad review I read back in December when they first opened, 7 months later, nothing has gotten better. I'm accustomed to a wait time at any Olive Garden, but was beyond surprised at how EMPTY the place was (and we still had to wait 20 minutes).  My guess is they don't have enough servers because the one server we had seemed to be working 8 or 9 tables.  It's the only thing I can think to explain how TERRIBLE the service was.  Once seated, it took a while for our waitress to show up.  Took forever for them to bring the salad and bread, and we had to repeatedly ask for water.  The waitress was friendly in that overly familiar kinda way that lets you know she was angling for a great tip (you know, a whole lotta ""hunny"", ""boo"" , ""sweetheart"" etc., but she kept mixing up what I requested or asking me multiple times what it was I had JUST asked her.  A refill request had to be made no less than THREE times, and the drinks for the kids were room temperature.  Not even an ice cube, smh.  Meals came out, no asking if we wanted cheese on our salad or foods, no question as to wine.  It felt...and I hate to say it this way...like an ""Olive Garden"" in the hood, which is what it is, but not what it should be when you are shelling out more than ""Popeye's"" money (which probably would have been the better move).  There was no ""when you're here, you're like family"" vibe the chain prides itself on.  I couldn't wait to go.  I asked for more bread sticks and a soda refill, instead they bought me the check.  I was with my two kids and went to take advantage of the ""kids eat for 99 cents deal""  with each adult entree and they tried to tell me it was only valid on one meal.  Sucks for them, I had already gone to the Olive Garden website and pulled up the promo saying it was up to 2 for each paid entree (always be ready, lol).  They see the offer, grudgingly accept it (as though they were doing ME a favor, lol), and tell me the bill will be adjusted in the system. I say thanks, request the refill AGAIN and after 10 minutes then I get the refill.  By this point I was TIGHT!  I just wanted to leave.  But didn't on principle, lol.   THE WORST is that they have these things called ""Ziosks"" at the tables (don't play the games, they WILL charge you), they use this at the end for the server to pay your bill and mine stood by me to make sure it all went through and that the suggested tip (20%) was okay with me.  I told her ""I'm going to give you 15% because I'm a decent human being and this is your livelihood, but if I'm being honest, the service was terrible."" I could tell she was accustomed to hearing that, she didn't even bat an eye (nor apologize), smh. So yeah...if you manage your expectations, it's not the worst place ever, just know this appears to be the standard level of service.  I am in no way a food snob, or uppity about my eating places (I eat tons of food from trucks, lol), but when you are throwing money at something, you expect the service to be at the very least acceptable.  After our food came to the table, it took our server 15 minutes to ask if everything was okay.  UNACCEPTABLE!  They keep it up like this, they're gonna go the way of the ""Joe's Crab Shack""  that was in Harlem for two seconds and had the same problems.  Goes to show, it does not matter how nice a place is, if the service doesn't match, folks are gonna stop coming.  You've been warned.",2.0,"100 W 125th St, New York, NY 10027",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Relative to other Olive Garden's that I've been to, this location is not good. Our server was clearly trying to pick up extra tables for tips and ironically gave us terrible service. Since we had waited to be seated, we already knew what we were ordering and told her that when she came by to introduce herself. She said that she would be right back, went to greet her next table (a much larger party of 8 compared to our 2), and forgot about us for the next 10 min. She came back and took the large party's order first, put that in the computer (visible from our seat) and then came back to us. We ordered, our drinks never came and neither did our server. We saw that she constantly checked on the large table, refilling their water, checking after food was delivered, whole nine yards. Once we were done eating, we had to get up out of our seat and step in her way to get her attention to ask for the check. She brought the check over and had charged us for the drinks that never came, which we informed her of. She said she would take that off the check and come back. She came back after both of us had gone to the restroom individually and talked to the manager. We really should have just walked out on that meal.

"My family got there before 7 and didn't get out until 9 bc the service was awful. First my husband doesn't eat pork and the waiter brought his order and it had bacon and the waiter tried to pass it off as beef. Second I ordered endless pasta and told him up front, I want to try these two dishes. The waiter brought 1 dish and I ate half and asked for the second. He says you can't order that bc the computer won't let me put it in. I told him it didn't make sense bc both dishes were on endless pasta. It took at least 30 minutes for the second dish.

There is a minicomputer on each table and I pushed the button to call the waiter and he still didn't come. I think even the manager walked past and didn't say anything to us. There were so many people working there who were walking around not being helpful, it was bizarre! Btw the restaurant wasn't half full. The food was ok. The lasagna was good, the chicken alfredo was bland. At the end of the ordeal the waiter basically processes payment at the table and watches u leave the tip. I'm not rich but I work and understand the struggle so I left him a tip. I also didn't call the manager which was me restraining myself.

If you haven't eaten a single item from you own kitchen or know what's cooking... How the hell should I trust you, or even eat here?

"I  would definitely say I was once a huge fan of Olive Garden. We were a party of 3 and we were seated pretty quickly on a Friday afternoon. Our waiter was nice but he was confused and took long to attend to us. Our food took about 35min to come out and everyones food was cold. My food looked like it had been left overs and it was just warmed up in a microwave the cheese was extremely dried up and stuck to the plate. I   then asked for them to change my meal to the new create your own lasagna. I ordered the Alfredo with chicken and shrimp. After ordering and waiting about 15min I asked our waiter how much longer it'll be, he stated another 15min as many people ordered before me. When I finally received my meal 35min later (everyone else had eaten their desert already) it didn't look like anything id ordered. Yes, there was chicken and shrimp but the lasagna had beef in it which wasn't in the ingredients. I  then ask the waiter if maybe he gave me someone else meal as it should only have Alfredo sauce I   even show him the photo on the menu. He takes this meal as well off of the bill and 10 minutes later the store manager comes by to let us know that it actually wasn't beef in the lasagna but that it was dried up cheese as it must have been burnt.

"This Olive Garden is nothing like the one in Valley Stream, NY. My sister took me and my Father out for Father's Day weekend. Granted the wait for a table was 15-20 minutes as compared to a nearby Red Lobster wait of 35 - 40 minutes. When we finally got our table...my elderly Father had gulped down the complimentary glass of white wine. My sister had ordered an appetizer (Stuffed Mushrooms), which she loved. I can't stand mushrooms. She said they were flavorful. Fine...I'll give Olive Garden props for that. Now as for the main courses...sis wanted the Stuffed Chicken Marsala...with the sauce on the side. Well guess what..all she got was a slab of mashed potato and two pieces of neglected chicken. My sister had complained to a Manager who said, ""Well customers have to realize that what the order is not going to look like the pictures. But, yeah..I saw when they brought that out to you. It did look gross."" So we asked why did they still serve it since it's ""gross""?? We kept apologizing to the server since we didn't have an issue with him..it was the chef who didn't do his/her job. My father said he loved the Chicken Giardino. The chicken was moist and fresh. He ate the whole thing. I had the Tour of Italy. Now, the chicken alfredo sauce was runny. The lasagna ehhhhhh had better. Thanks goodness for the chicken parmesan, which was delicious! As for the drinks..I had the Green Apple Moscato Sangria, which was watered down...no flavor. Pops had the Mixed Berry Sparkling Water, which he loved since he loves berries. My sister...I believe..got the Blueberry Limonata, which she said was tasty. So would we go back to this Olive Garden...nahhhhhhh it's ok.

"Stopped by today to  have lunch with my mom. Must say this is a very friendly Olive Garden Restaurant: from the lovely greeter who sets up your table wait time to the seater(?) who escorts you to your table. This restaurant is quite big and the bar scene seems cozy. The main dining room is a nice homage to Tuscan dining: from the wall composed of brick and stone, the faux fireplaces and wall sconces.The dining tables of light wood lend a rustic feel. The waiters are attentive and accommodating. The lunch menu is a watered down version of the main menu: you can start off with tasty apps like fried mozzarella, calamari or the app we chose: fried zucchini bites. The bites were stuffed with zucchini and Parmesan and marinara sauce is there for dipping. The portion is enough for sharing. The lunch options consist of lite bites like chicken and vegetable padiana, soup and salad: pasta fagiole, Tuscan soup with sausage and vegetables and the chicken and gnocchi. Then there is the option of building your own pasta or pasta cucina mia: choose your pasta, sauce and filler like chicken or grilled shrimp. There are the old standby eggplant and chicken parmigiana or chicken piccata. My mom chose the chicken Margherita which consisted of grilled chicken smothered in tomatoes, basil pesto and a side of Parmesan encrusted zucchini. I opted for the  never ending soup and salad combo: I cheated and ordered the chicken and gnocchi: a creamy soup with dumplings, spinach and chicken. Very tasty. The salad still is the standout: the greens with pepperoncini, black olives, tomatoes, red onion, garlic croutons and that zesty dressing. Our waiter Anthony was very attentive and courteous. What's great about the combos is you get to take an extra bowl of soup and salad home; which I did. The desserts looked very tempting: tiramisu and assorted ice creams. The cocktail menu had a nice variety of beers, margaritas, moscato and sangrias to choose from. Prices range from $6.99-$18.99. There is a credit card machine which allows you to charge your meal without asking for the bill as well as order your food without waiter attention. All in all a nice place to dine for a lite lunch. Honorable mention to Shawn who escorted us to our tables, really nice guy.",4.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This location can be a hit or miss. However, my recent trip there wasn't too bad. It was St. Patricks Day so we waited 40 minutes to be seated, which was to be expected anyway for a Saturday evening. Our appetizer of calamari arrived prior to our drinks, so timing was a little bit off as we waited awhile for our drinks. The food tasted fairly good not great as Olive Garden never seems to cook their pasta al dente. Pasta for all three of our entrees were overcooked. As part of a chain, I don't expect the highest quality in anything except convenience. Our server, despite looking tired, was extremely nice and attentive to our table. Salad and breadsticks thereafter were promptly refilled, same goes for our drinks. Each person at the table may choose soup or salad as their unlimited item, it no longer applies to the entire table. That change in ordering style does not seem so bad, but I guess it's not the greatest setup for a larger group. The only issue encountered was when we requested a second refill of the soup we were told it would be another 30 minutes as they have to make more. We said no problem since we were in no rush so 30 minutes go by and she returns to informs us that it will take longer as they need to gather the ingredients. We decided to forego waiting any longer, and declined the offer to try the other available soups. I feel there was some miscommunication between the server and kitchen, but besides this minor issue, the rest of the experience was pretty good. I like the little tablet that is located on every table where you can re-order drinks, or menu items, call over your server and most importantly you can view your receipt and pay (with card) without waiting for the server. It can even print out a copy of your receipt. So that's a cool and convenient feature. Overall, I wouldn't make this a regular or a go-to spot for lunch or dinner. It's really out of convenience if you're out shopping in the gateway center and happen to get hungry, it's not a bad option but I generally wouldn't recommend going out of your way to dine here.",3.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Came here on President's day and there were a bunch of people waiting for a table. We made ""reservations"" which hold our place in line to shorten the wait time when we arrive. Good thing we did that, our wait went from 30 minutes to 10. Our waitress Nicole was very enthusiastic and even wore makeup in honor of the holiday. We were seated at 4:55 and had made it in time to take advantage of their early dinner duo promotion-- which was 8.99 for Unlimited salad paired with a choice of entree. My only gripe with my experience here was my food took more than 30 minutes to prepare. With no apps, I  endulged in the salad and conversation until my good was ready. **try their kiwi melon limonata, it's pretty darn good! Our bill was the best part of the night.

"This is probably going to be a one time only place. My kids enjoyed it, but I must say I've been spoiled so extra slow service is just not acceptable. Especially when it's not a packed restaurant. I decided to try the fill up pasta bowl for $9.99. First off I had to ask if there was a menu for the fill up bowl because the hosts didn't give us one. Then the waiter wasn't sure if they were doing the fill up bowls, yet it was written huge on their welcome to Olive Garden board in the FRONT of the restaurant. No matter things happen, so moving on, we had to wait 20 mins to be served the free salad and bread. Now my kids love this part because they can eat two servings and not get full. LOL! We had to wait another 10 mins after their first sitting, because the waiter forgot all about us. The food was okay, I ordered the Chicken Alfredo, but I've had better. My daughter and son had the spaghetti and meatballs. How do you only serve 2 meatballs, why not 3? Other than the service and a okay food I won't be a frequent visitor.

"My son had been asking to try the early dinner deal, so I decided to take him yesterday. Upon arrival, the restaurant had a really strange smell, as if someone tossed their cookies. We thought maybe it was just in the foyer section of the restaurant, so we moved in closer and waited for someone to seat us. A woman showed to a nice booth, which was cool, since it was only two of us. It was nice to have the extra space. That made me feel like we were of to a good start. I was wrong. After watching more than one server and bus person attend to tables ALL around us. The people in front of us, in back of us and across from us. But NEVER us. It wasn't packed and that whole time NOBODY noticed that two people still had menus and not even glasses of water on the table? Moving all around and NOBODY checked, just in case? And, 25 minutes later we were not helped. I usually leave after about 10 minutes or so, but my son really wanted the bread sticks, so I stayed for him. Eventually, I put my foot down and we walked out. The woman who gave us the menus pleaded for us to stay, but I told her maybe next time and it wasn't her fault.",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I was craving Fettuccine Alfredo so my boyfriend and I decided to drop by Olive Garden for dinner. Upon arrival, the host informed us it would be a 20-25 minute wait and handed us the buzzer. We waited outside on the benches, and 25 minutes later, went back to check on our seats. Another hostess was there and informed me she called us, which I replied our buzzer never buzzed. Then she told me our buzzer was broken, gave us a new one, and told us to wait for the next available table. After a while, we were brought over to our seats. Our waitress came over to ask us for our order and the whole time she sounded a bit confused. We had to repeat our order several times until she got it, which left us pretty annoyed. We ordered the calamari appetizer to share, Fettuccine Alfredo, and Tour of Italy which consisted of chicken parmigiana, spaghetti with meat sauce, and cheese ravioli with marinara. The bread sticks, salad, and soup all came out in a timely manner. The bread sticks were alright. Usually they're warm/hot but this time it felt like they were left out for a while. Would not recommend getting calamari from this Olive Garden. The calamari was too chewy and there was too much batter. The portions are also really small. After our appetizer, it took another 30 minutes for my boyfriend's entree to come. The spaghetti looked like its been sitting for a while, it was really stiff, and the dish overall was a little cold. The waiter then informed us the fettuccine would be on its way out in a bit. She brought over the fettuccine after serving another table. She had taken her time with the other table and just dropped off the fettuccine in front of me. Both times she didn't offer cheese for our entrees. The most disgusting part was when she was dropping it in front of me, her entire thumb was digging into my noodles (her nails were super long). She noticed that I saw but didn't apologize or say anything and just left. At this point I was just disgusted and repulsed. I tossed half of my entree (the part she touched) and attempted to work on the other half. I just wanted to leave so we called her over to ask for a to go box. That took another 10 minutes, so we just called over another waitress and she came over right away with a bag and box. Our waitress came over after and we told her we already had everything and left. Looking back, I deeply regret not asking for the manager and complaining. This is by far the worst Olive Garden experience I've ever had.",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
I've never been to an Olive Garden before and probably won't ever go again. Friends chose to meet here for dinner and drinks recently. Our waitress pulled up a chair and sat next to us while taking our order. She said she didn't feel well and was too tired to stand. Took about 20 mins to receive our mixed drinks. My drink tasted like the bartender used a shaker that wasn't properly washed from the last drink he made. Absolutely disgusting. We asked several times for glasses of waters. They didn't come until AFTER our meal was served. The food itself was decent at best. The waitress left us to use the pay machine on the table but didn't fully explain how to use it and was frustrated when we asked for help.

"This place needs a serious overhaul! As far as I'm concerned, a restaurant of such a reputable franchise should  close its doors until all upgrades and improvements are made to correct that prominent Ugly Green B rating that greets customers at the door!!! I NEVER eat at B grade restaurants, but because their menu provided the best options for the individuals in our group, we decided to look past it, hoping that they would have somehow begun to clean up their act (pun intended). Well, to their credit, I must say they lived up to that B rating. We were given no cloth napkins, but a stack of paper napkins instead. My friend asked for lemon for her fish, and it was promptly brought on a piece of the same cheap paper napkin that was sticking to it by the timed it was plopped on the table in front of her. The most disturbing thing, however, is that the culture of mediocrity is so pervasive that the waitress was completely oblivious to the look of consternation on all of our faces, and my other friend's disbelieving query of, ""That's the lemon?"", as she's gazing at the soggy tissue. She responded cheerily, ""Yes, that's it!"" I was floored! To complete the B rating experience, I was almost literally floored as I skidded on what felt like a film of grime or grease on the exposed tile as I was exiting the dining area. However, I have no one to blame but myself. I admit that I am a part of the problem. I watched that glaring B rating and walked right in. Well, lesson learned. I am not setting foot in this location again, unless that B rating changes to an 'A', and management acknowledges all of these negative reviews and makes a commitment to improved service in the future.

Awful service.  Went here for my niece's graduation dinner. It was 11 of us. There website says if your party is more than 6ppl then you have to call to join the waiting list.  So I called.  The hostess said that we could not place our names on the waiting list but just come over because it will be a 6-10 min wait. When we get there the same hostess from the phone call acknowledges that she spoke to me and now the wait is 1.5 hours long!!!! We would have left but my niece wanted to go there.  What made it worse is the manager said that we were given the wrong information and that we could put our names on the list!!!! Manager then says he will get us in earlier and make it up to us.  Instead we were punished even more!  We then waited almost 2 hrs to be seated.  It's now 9pm.  We then wait 1 WHOLE HOUR for entrees to come out.

I thought it was clever that they had welcome signs in Italian to fit with the theme of the restaurant and offered drinks at half-price while you wait for your table. Genius! Thankfully, we didn't have to wait. Since it was a Friday evening, we opted to beat the weekend crowd by dining before shopping. There was definitely a line as we walked out. This was our first time dining with our eight-month old so the high chair that was offered was very convenient. Our server, Ronnee, was ah-mazing. So courteous, helpful, attentive, and personable. We asked for a baby-friendly snack and she immediately brought over some grapes for him. Lol, our son was not impressed and toyed around with them instead. Most of them ended up on the floor. I loved that we could sample wine, before ordering a glass. Who doesn't love the unlimited breadsticks and salad? Since my aim is to always try something new whenever, I created my own pasta bowl (whole grain linguine with asiago garlic alfredo sauce and grilled chicken $11.99). Great dish, but those garlic pieces were unexpected. I thought it would have been more discreet in the dish. Since I'm not a beer or wine connoisseur the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 was everything to me.

Food: 2.5/5.0 Service: 3.0/5.0 Value: 3.5/5.0 Decor: 3.0/5.0 Overall: 3.0/5.0 Food was okay but greasy per usual.  Friendly service though the server had a lot of tables to juggle for the current front-of-house process (maybe time to revisit).  Wait times can get pretty heavy as this is [sadly] probably one of the better restaurants in the area and it's right off the Belt Parkway.,3.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I guarantee there is a large vat of salt that these people use to season the food. Everything tastes like pure unadulterated salt! The place makes zero effort to make their food have any other discernible flavor. The service is paint by the numbers: barely passible but not offensive enough to make you get up and leave. These chain restaurants simply suck, but hey I didn't pay for my meal so it's a win as far as I am concerned. Also the bread sticks don't taste anywhere near as good as they used to.",2.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This has been a place that I've gone to since I was little and haven't gone back there until recently. A lot of people complain about the wait times, which are a long time whenever it is a busy night. However, when I went recently it was not much of a wait and my family and I were seated right away. The food is pricey, ranging in $15+. So, I decided to try something new and went with the beef tortellini. The tortellini was really good, I would definitely get it again. And the beef was nice and tender, a plus since I don't really like beef too hard. You also get unlimited soup or salad with one entree. The strawberry lemonade I got was also really good and huge as well for just $3.50. The other dishes my family got were all extremely good as well. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the food since it was filling.",4.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I don't remember Olive Garden being this bad.  As soon as we stepped in m, it was freezing. The AC was turned on really high, which I understand if it's really hot outside, but it wasn't. The food wasn't great either. We ordered the mussels in garlic marinara sauce, five cheese ziti, and pepperoni fettuccine Alfredo. The food was super salty.  The ziti was already cold by the time it got to our table. Wait time for service was extremely long, especially towards the end of the meal. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to get us boxes and bags. The one star was earned by the waitress being friendly, but she was M.I.A. for most of the time. She checked on us a couple times, but didn't come by often enough to refill our drinks. And she seemed really forgetful. We asked for her to print a receipt since the tablet on the table had run out of ink. She left and come back in two minutes and asked what we needed again. When we finally got our receipt and boxes, she accidentally left food intended for another table at our table.

"I will be writing this review live, meaning not after my dining experience but during. I am currently sitting down waiting for my food to come. They have this new device powered by Ziosk. It's basically a tablet or mini screen that allows you to order drinks, food, call your server and even play games. You can also sign up for their eClub to win free meals. I placed my food order at 4:50. I asked for shrimp Alfredo with out the shrimp which is basically fettuccine Alfredo according to my server. All entrees come with unlimited salad or soup and breadsticks. I asked for the salad and breadsticks. At 4:55 she came back with my salad and breadsticks but has not taken my menu nor brought my drink. They are having a free wine sampler and she asked me if I wanted some, me being underage and not a wine person anyways I declined. Apparently I am also able to order drinks on the Ziosk tablet, without checking my ID. Great, I said sarcastically. I finished the entire salad bowl and breadsticks. It is now 5:05 and she came back with my iced coffee that contains ice but is not cold and I have to self apply the sugar with no spoon to stir it with. Also it was in a plastic to go cup not a glass. It's like they don't put sugar in it just to make sure I have something to do while I wait for my food and I guess for those who prefer sugar alternatives. She asked me if I wanted more salad and breadsticks. How is that even a question. Another server, the one who showed me to my table just placed a menu on the table. It's too late for that buddy, should of been pre-prepared. At 5:10 she came with some salad but no breadsticks. Still no food. Currently 30 mins after walking in and sitting down and I finally got my food. Some of the noddles are extremely undercooked while others are okay. She gave me some breadsticks, only two this time not three. No salad as of yet. Also the previous breadstick bowl is still on my table. I have a couple next to me that arrived almost at the same time as I did and the gentleman ordered the complimentary wine which he still has yet to receive. I overheard the young lady say that her noodles were hard and lacked sauce. That she would prefer to make it at home and I agree. At 5:33 the same mentioned gentleman finally received his complimentary wine and it was literally, *pause for dramatic affect*, literally two sips. Sips. Okay lol like the amount you give your teenage daughter on her sweet sixteen. I never received my refill breadsticks and salad. I guess two is the cap amount. As a vegetarian that's usually all we eat when we go to a place with low vegetarian options. 5:36 and my server came to finally take the plate. Notice I said plate not plates. There is still dirty plates and breadsticks bowls on my table. She also asked me if I wanted more breadsticks, now right? I declined. 5:40 and I asked for my check. Overall it wasn't terribly offensive service but it was bad. I feel bad because I feel like they are trying but it's just not there yet. I'll try again and update this review but if I don't, it's not a surprise.",2.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I use to love Olive Garden until now. First of all the waiting was ""45"" min when it was an hour. When we sat at the table the guy ""mich"" ( short version of his real name) asked if we could start of with any drinks. He forgot his pen and had to run out and get it. When you came back I asked for simple drinks that didn't really need repetition. After he took our order. Instead of bringing a tray full of our drinks he brought it one at a time. He forgot one drink and gave it to me after the salad which didn't make any sense. Salad and break took a long time to get too. We asked for bread again and t took him 10 min. It entrees came and we ate. He asked if we didn't anything else we asked for bread again. Took him 10 min and by then the food was gone. We were very tired at this point so we just wanted to check. We over heard a customer behind us having the same problem. After we left I realized something that was very odd and not right. They are rated ""B"" and they decided to out the sign up behind a tree where no one can see. That is not right for us as the customers taking advantage of us.

"If you want to have a nice quick meal, do NOT come here! My family and I went there for a late-lunch/dinner on Sunday. We thought it would be nice to go eat at Olive Garden since we haven't been there in a couple of years. Walking in, it did not look exceptionally busy since there was only another family waiting outside with us. However, the waiting time was long. We waited for a pretty long time (probably around 40 mins) even though I felt that it was not busy at all. Also when it was time for us to be seated, we went up to the counter and no one was there! We waited for a few minutes until a worker finally passed by and told us that we needed to wait at the counter on the other side. After walking to the counter, no one was there either. A few workers passed by me and didn't even direct us to our table or talked to us. It looked like the workers looked like they were busy chatting in the kitchen than attending to customers. Not a very good experience for the first hour there. When someone finally came to the counter and showed us to our table, the waiter took years to come to us. The service was extremely slow and it took a long time for our waiter to order our drinks and our meal. At one point it was so slow that I literally thought to myself that they probably forgot about us. The wait for our appetizers was pretty slow and then, what it felt like forever, waiting for our entrees. Now down to the food. The food was like a typical Olive Garden Chain-Italian Restaurant. Nothing special really. Our waiter was nice enough to come by with a refill of breadsticks even though we didn't ask for it. For one of our appetizer, we got the Garlic Mussels Marinara and that was good. For the entree, the Spaghetti Rosso with Chicken & Bacon matched to my taste. I would recommend getting that if you are not a big fan of the creamy alfredo sauces. I have eaten at many Olive Gardens in Upstate New York, NYC and New Jersey, Georgia and this one is one of the lower ranking ones that I've been to.

"Olive Garden is once again a huge disappointment.... Big surprise.  When we walked it we weren't greeted, we stood at the front counter without any greeting and we're shown to our seats.  We were only given one menu and the host said he'd go get us one but he showed other people to their table and gave them menus but forgot ours again.  We ordered quickly but it took over 40 minutes to get our food. People who were seated 10 minutes after us got their food before us and we're done by the time ours came. I work in a restaurant, for two people to get two plates of pasta it should take no more than 15 minutes. Especially in a practically empty restaurant.  It was obvious the waitress forgot about us, but instead of telling us this she just said it should be right out, it still took an additional 15 minutes.  Also the food.... Ok it's pasta and potatoes  and chicken.  Our portions were tiny. I thought this place was known for huge plates, that was the only thing they had going for them. Not service, not quality HUGE portions.  They were not, I figured they reduced them because people are more calorie conscious these days but come on. If you reduce the portions then reduce the price. We paid 17$ for chicken and pasta and 15$ for a chicken breast with a mashed potatoe.  Overall the service sucked, the food was average with tiny positions and it was overpriced.  I can't give anything over 1 star for this place. Well just boil water and cook pasta at home and save 30$.",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Whenever you walk up to an Olive Garden and see a crowd of people gathered outside you know you're going to be waiting for a while to enjoy your meal. That was the case this past Sunday when I was in the mood for some generic Italian food... aka Olive Garden. If you go on a weekend be prepared to wait 60-90 minutes to sit down and enjoy a meal. If you've never ventured into this part of Brooklyn, you're not missing much. This particular Olive Garden is located on Gateway Dr, which is surrounded by a ton of stores like Target and directly across from a Red Lobster. It reminds me a bit of Bay Plaza (located in the Bronx), prior to the new mall opening up. The cuisine is your typical Italian cuisine such as lasagna, alfredo, and chicken parm, just to name a few. I went with the Tour of Italy, which features those 3 dishes all on one platter. Of course, they get you with the unlimited salad and bread sticks before you actually enjoy your meal. Expect to spend at least an hour there, even if you're a Speedy Gonzalez with a fork in hand, due to the service. The service, like most have mentioned on here, is rather questionable. I didn't receive great service, but I didn't have a rude employee either. Honestly, I wouldn't go back to this location because the service (wrong orders/long wait time) and food didn't leave much desire to go back. FYI - If you want to AVOID a long wait, this location does have call ahead service for seating, reservations, and even a To Go cashier, if you want to take your food and enjoy it at home.",2.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Honestly, were it not for the Olive Garden gift card I'd been sitting on since last Christmas, restaurants like this would never see me. Located in Brooklyn's Gateway Mall, The Olive Garden is everything it could ever be as far as food goes. Unremarkable Italian-y pasta dishes, appetizers and desserts with a great wine and cocktail selection. It's rarely crowded because almost everyone is across the way waiting to eat frozen, reheated seafood at Red Lobster. Anyway, skip the steak Gorgonzola. Bland fettuccine noodles covered in a boring sauce with even more boring slices of steak. Salad and soft bread sticks are always tasty. Appetizers are damn near amazing after a drink or two. Mozzarella cheese triangles are my fave. I was fortunate to have a server last night named Chantè who was pleasant, patient and soooo pretty to look at.

"When we arrived our waiter appeared to be excellent. After placing our order he became involved in a physical staff altercation that he did not cause. Our food was served cold, and reheated.  Approximately 5 Olive Garden employees were in and out of the kitchen trying to stop one of their coworkers who punched the wall. We found no sign of management during the entire length of our visit.  It appears that the wait staff has no structure. There was a large serving platter of dirty dishes left approximately 10 feet away from my wife in the middle of the restaurant.  The serving platter of dirty dishes was present for 35 minutes during our meal. Prior to placing a dessert order my wife made comment to our server that she felt leaving a platter of dirty dishes in the middle of the restaurant in plain sight was inappropriate.  Our server told my wife in a very polite manner that the platter was not in his section. As we enjoyed the food during the course of our dinner it was glaringly apparent that there is zero management structure and a complete lack of professionalism and team effort with little to no thought of the guest experience.

So as far as perception, it seemed as though there lacked a sense of urgency in presentation, getting tables bussed and overestimating quote times to guests which affect business. As for my experience at the bar; it was great. My bartenders name was Sherene and her attention to detail, cleanliness and sense of urgency was great that night. The food was also great; we had the chicken & shrimp carbonara. The only entree that was off was the cheese ravioli in which we returned.

This is a big deal. I cannot trust a place with crappy crappers! For some reason it isn't crazy loud either I go to eat here at least twice a month and I have never felt annoyed by chatter.

"I'm going to cut to the chase here. It's Sunday night. We get to Olive Garden to wait list ourselves for a table at 7pm. We get called in at about 8pm. Fine, that's a reasonable wait time, considering how packed the place is on a night where every family comes together. We get seated. We didn't get even our glasses of waters until half an hour later. By the time we placed our order for food, we didn't even get those until another half an hour to 45 minutes. Am I exaggerating? Maybe. But the wait time was horrendous in between for everything! My unlimited bread sticks and salad didn't even come til after the glasses of water, before out entrees. Three people in my family ordered the never-ending pasta bowl- but instead, yes, it ended right there after they had to wait yet again another half an hour for our waitress to return to take their orders for another pasta bowl. She didn't even show up to deliver the next set of pasta bowls about 20-30 minutes later! I got so frustrated with the service, I knew I had to order dessert to go. By the time I actually got the check (I was treating my family for dinner), it was 9:15pm. Why did we have to wait 2 hours to get our food and for our waitress to return sporadically to check up on us? I was going to tip less than 15% because I was very dissatisfied with the whole night.

"My boyfriend and I wanted to have some dinner while shopping. It was so crowded and we waited, but after the dinner experience I didn't think it was worth the wait. The shrimp scampi appetizer was so over salted and left me really thirsty. I think I was able to retain water for the next 2 days like a camel. I'm sure I exceeded the daily recommendation for sodium for a few days in that one sitting. They do give you a lot of food. It was my first time there, I ordered the ravioli and it was not tasty. The best part came when it was time to pay. The server had a little machine on the table and since we split the bill we were asked electronically to leave separate tips. Meantime I'm paying first and the server is doing the shuffle behind me and kind of giggling. Nothing like someone behind your  back while your paying the bill. I wanted to ask my boyfriend how much to tip, a moment alone to talk about that. But I wound up sliding the tip scale down because I knew he was tipping also. Together we would not have left a $12 tip and the scale was on $6 as default. I said no way. What a scam to try to get you to pay like that. It took me a minute or so to try and bring the scale down with my finger and the server was still behind me doing the shuffle I could hear it. First of all I didn't want that machine at the table. We asked them to take it away then they insisted they needed it. Then they took it away, then they brought it back again. I didn't want to eat with this ""tv"" monitor blocking room on the table and glaring in our faces. Call me old school but sometimes dinner conversation and good food and enjoying each other's company is what were there for than being asked to pay for games, order appetizers and be hounded to pay at the table. No I won't go back. We spent hours there for an overly salted meal and game of take away and bring back that machine, which is a scam when it comes time to paying and an annoyance overall.

Yes ""her furniture"" very rude like if she owns Olive Garden that's not her table. The beeper timer they gave us and told us to wait for 30 mins we actually waited an hour. Not to mention our waitress was super slow we realized why we waited so long. She would come back every 30 mins we got there at 8 and left at 11. She offered us a free glass of wine and forgot to give us the wine, we had to remind her! Questioned what we were ordering and why we didn't order more. Usually we get filled with salad and take the food to go. So we asked her for the take out boxes and she came back with the smallest boxes very ditzy waitress. We got our food so late but lemme tell you when I ate I completely forgot about everything there food is really great and satisfying anything on the menu. Iv been here before like I said sometimes you get a good waitress other times no. Over all I love it though will be back again.",4.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Waited half hour. But the food was worth the way, but to be honest, I'm not doing it again. The house salad n breadsticks came first. In my opinion is that they do that so people don't complain about their ordered food to come. You get unlimited refills if you order an non-alcholic beverage. However, trying to get the server's attention when wanting drinks and salad and breadsticks is tough. You are lucky if you do get another. We got the 2 for $29. It was good and hot. I would come again but not on a holiday dinner time when they were short on staff.",4.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"So, my in-laws were given a couple gift cards for their birthdays earlier this year, and they insisted on bringing us along for dinner.  I'm all for a free dinner out, even if it is at a chain restaurant, we all know the salad and bread sticks at The Olive Garden are awesome.  And if  you were to tell me ""no they're not"" I'd totally point at you and yell ""liar!."" Anyway... We arrived at 5pm, figuring that was a good time... kind of early for a NYC crowd.  Of course we weren't thinking about the fact that it was Sunday...and some people like to eat early on Sundays so they can go home and get ready for work.  So we arrived... gave our name to the hostess (who looked miserable to be standing there greeting people) and were told it would be about 35-40 minutes.  And so we stood... and waited.  While we waited... for what ended up being 45ish minutes... I noticed that booths in the bar were open.  At one point a total of three booths we open.  One in particular remained full of dishes for about 20 minutes after the diners had left.  20 minutes!?  Olive Garden must not believe in filling their booths.  Hey OG- empty booths = less $$ for you.  Duh.  At one point I went to ask the hostess if she could give me an idea of how much time we had left... she said there were three parties ahead of us.  Hmmm... three parties in front of us, huh?  How about seating them at the three empty booths in the bar dining area? Whatever... We finally made it to a table... and sat for ten minutes before we were greeted by our waitress for the night.  I'd like to start off by saying that our waitress was delightful.  When she finally arrived she answered our questions about the menu, took our drink orders and did so without any sign of annoyance.  In fact she kept her cool the entire night, even though you could see she was visibly tired and busy trying to keep up with her tables.   We all ordered a version of the ""Never Ending Pasta Bowl.""  While my in-laws & I opted for soup, hubby ordered a salad with his pasta... and because the kitchen was backed up and it would be a few extra minutes for our soups our waitress brought us over some extra bowls so we could enjoy some salad while we waited.  Like always- the salad was cool and crisp and nicely tossed in the house dressing.  Soups (chicken & gnocchi) finally came out and were piping hot and delicious. Throughout the rest of the meal our waitress was good to check in on us.  Our food was brought out in a timely manner and our drinks were refilled without us having to ask.  When we asked for more bread sticks she didn't balk.  And when we asked for a refill of our pasta (never ending bowl, hello!) to take home she said ""no problem, I'll see if I can get you a couple extra meatballs too.""  And then she brought an extra basket of bread sticks for us to bring home too.  :-) So.. what started off as a long tiring wait ended with a yummy chain-style Italian dinner, with plenty of left overs for lunch! Next time (which won't be any time soon...) maybe OG could pay closer attention to the empty tables... and seat people more promptly.  Then maybe people wouldn't have to wait an hour for a table... yeah, that'd be nice.... To recap this review (which might be the longest I've ever written(?).  Who would have thought I'd write so much about an Olive Garden...) - Miserable hostess. - Ridiculously long wait / empty tables - Awesome waitress. - Fantastic bread sticks. - Slow kitchen. - Extra meatballs to take home.",3.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I must say we are very disappointed. We've been to this establishment before and we have never had such poor service and the place is literally falling apart. First table that we were assigned to in the bar area the bench was broken. They sat us further in the restaurant to notice that the decor where the plants and plates are haven't been cleaned for months. Tables were sticky, nasty, dirty. My husband went to the bathroom it's only lunch time. He informed that the bathrooms grotesque. Urine on the floors and all over the urinals, said it was so bad that he was slipping on the urine. A health inspector needs to come to this establishment as soon as possible. The only good thing about this place was our waitress. We ordered our food. Another disappointment. It had no flavor and it looked like our food came out of a frozen dinner bag. I ordered the tour of Italy my pasta was over cooked and had no flavor and my chicken Parmesan was over cooked. Doesn't look like we will be coming back to this place. Sad, it was once a gem in Brooklyn.",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I didn't mind the lack of any strong liquor flavoring, I got an extra before I hit the road.  The drink was the real hero of my meal. Anyone who's been to Olive Garden knows, salad & breadsticks are great, as long as you want they will keep bringing you more, I can't ever get passed the first bowl of salad however, but keep the breadsticks coming :) Best time to go is around 530ish, me and my friend were seated immediately which is important to me, I sure do hate waiting...

"Went here for dinner and was very disappointed. The wait to get a seat for two people took over 30 minutes. When we were finally seated the waiter gave us an electronic way to order our food and left us. We were finally able to get a waiter to take our orders after awhile instead of placing the orders through the computer our self. They provided us with the salad and breadsticks which was nice. We ordered the bottomless pasta bowls and was very disappointed. The food quality is what you expect, but the quantity is very poor. The second round of pasta comes in a children's bowl instead of a full bowl which is very disappointing. I asked for more breadsticks twice as we were told it was unlimited breadsticks and we were never given any. This alone makes going to this Olive Garden a no. The waiter never came to help us after that or refill our water. To make things worse they added a 20% gratuity automatically to the bill. This is ridiculous considering the service was one of the worst I have experienced. For a business this is very poor service and I would highly recommend staying away from this location. Stay away and take your money elsewhere!",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"OMG slowest and most painful service ever. No wonder the lines at the door are that long. This is my second and final review for this place, they switched waitresses on us, the breadsticks came after we finished our salad. The first waitress was rude and just walked up and asked if we would like to order our meals, no drink and appetizer order first. Yes I know it's close to closing time you stupid bitch, but you missed out on the mandatory $30 tip that was on the bill, it's a good thing you left early with your 2 gentlemen friends who you were serving. Everything took forever, when the food finally arrived my plate was scalding hot and my pasta was dead cold.

Why?  Because where else can you get unlimited bread sticks and salad bowls?  Certainly not at that crap italian place Babbo.  go there if you want to eat like a baboon.  Come to Olive Garden (""OG"") if you want to eat with family. that being said, do not get their margaritas.  You might as well get a slurpie.  The Seafood  Portofino plate was not bad.  The Tour of Italy entree is more like a tour of various bad entrees.  From my tastings it appears to me that dishes that rely on a cream/wine based sauce were far superior to marinara based servings that are way too salty.  One of my friends can't eat gluten (loser!).  The pasta dish he got looked disgusting. So why 3 stars?  It's next to Target.  The bread sticks and salad are really great.  The prices are fair.  Also, everyone is always laughing.

"Went here today and I have to say this is the worst Olive Garden I've ever been to .. To start I have to say they seated us pretty quickly for a Friday night ( best part ) our server Chris came shortly after and gave us some wine ( not bad ) we order drinks I ordered a mango margarita which tasted like frozen margarita you buy from the frozen section in a target or something it was Awful .. Sent it back and order a regular margarita its was awful idk if the bartenders tonight are tired or have been taken shots in between making drinks but it was really really bad ... I order my food I got the mussels and majority of them wasnt open ( therefore they are not done ) so the food was awful . I went Starving and left starving the manager didn't even ask if I wanted anything else or anything just took the food and left . The staff is very very young and very unprofessional they where very loud yelling to each other about stupid stuff playing while guest are eating we even sow two servers making out for a quick second in the cut .. I will never go back to this Olive Garden and I will make sure to tell everyone I know Not to go to to this Olive Garden it was awful , a waste of time and a waste of money people don't want to spend money they worked hard for to get crappy food and crappy service but I blame management for not teaching and training these kids to give proper service ..

Fake Italian- Fakalian? Not having walked 20 feet from Red Lobster one of the guys has to take another squirt.  Since the car was parked closer to Olive Garden than Red Lobster - in we went.

I was tempted to get my sunglasses.  This was especially annoying since Red Lobster was nice and dimly lit. We ordered a round of drinks while waiting for mister pissy pants and although they did have some decent wines by the glass - the bartender was totally uninterested in having us there.  Not that the place was booming- it was d.o.a. so he should have been real happy to see us.

Plus, the bill only came to 25 bucks! You really can't beat that - Never ending pasta bowls, 2 beverages, unlimited salad and breadsticks, definitely worth it for that price.

This is not a bad looking restaurant for being in the hood .. I went there and there was an hour wait on a Sunday and I decided to sit at the bar by the time I got to my table an hour and fifteen minutes later I was already tipsy. I had the unlimited bowl of pasta and meatballs.. it was alright. I was never to fond of chain restaurants. I consider the Olive Garden Fake Italian food. Blah lol. I They serve food at the bar and I saw one of the bartenders remove hair from one of the plates that was being taking out to go. I will never order take out from there. Oh yeah I almost thought I was in Jamaica while sitting at the bar everyone was Jamaican Yeh mon.. LOL,1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"WE ate there with my dad, as a post Father's Day dinner. Well, the wait was 40 minutes, for a party of 5...ridiculous. We never factored in the graduates/graduations that were taking place that day. Once we got to our table we felt like we were in Antartica! It was FREEZING in that place! Our waitress was ok. She was attentive and she did listen to our needs. I ordered the Four Cheese PastaChetta with Chicken. Well, the chicken was barely breaded and one of the pieces was undercooked where I could NOT cut it with my knife. The save here, I told my waitress that I could not complete my meal due to my chicken being undercooked. She actually told the chef and he prepared ANOTHER dish for me, free of charge. Thank goodness for that. I was READY to write a letter to corporate. Bathrooms nice, ambiance- basic Olive Garden. Have had better OG experiences.",2.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Great family-style chain restaurant. Nice decor and comfortable seating arrangements. The service took quite long and the waitresses were a tad-bit on the rude side. The place was packed since I was there for lunch on Sunday. Overall, the food was your average olive garden food. Service was a downside. The wait was not long. Easy parking. I'd say 3 out of 5 is not bad.",3.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Went here last Sunday with my fiance and my son. The wait was about an hour, which was to be expected being that it was Sunday at dinner time. The food was good, basic Olive Garden fare. The service was good also. Our waiter was very attentive. Made sure that we got our breadsticks and salad. My son had a Pizza which he liked, I had the trio which was good and my fiance had a Salmon dish which she liked. One issue though, it seemed like the fryer was broken or something that the fried appetizers that we order took a long time to come. Our waiter mentioned this and was apologetic. But the appetizer came after the entrees and we took it home. We had just about finished our meal. We ordered some Tiramisu and cappuccino which were good. All in all, spent $100.00 including the tip. Would difinately go back. Got better service than at the Red Lobster across the parking lot.

Yes the wait time can be bad, even on a Thursday night, but once you get seated you get what you came for - breadsticks, salad, and whatever you have room for. The waiters who have served me are a notch above waiters at other places (Applebees or Chilis), while the plates are all what you enjoy about the OG.

"This restaurant is simply amazing. When I was a young girl I really didn't like pasta or fettuccine, so throughout my life I just stayed away from it. About a year ago I decided that I was tired of eating at my usual restaurants so I decided to try Olive Garden. It's safe to say that this was one of the best decisions that I have ever made! When I entered the brick oven shaped restaurant I was immediately impressed by the service I had received. Employees greeted me at the door with friendly smiles and offered a seat on a cozy couch as I waited to be called for my table. The restaurant is very beautiful inside. It looks very old fashioned however in a way modernized. When we were being seated I felt as if I could have been in a restaurant in Italy. Once we ordered our food our waitress provided an endless supply of delicious, warm, soft, buttery bread with a salad that had onions, tomatoes, olives, croutons, and salad dressing. It was delicious. Though I recommend not eating too much of it, the endless supply could get you full, then you would have spent money on a meal that you could not eat. The meals weren't very expensive, for dinner you could not spend more than $20 on yourself unless you buy two meals. I've seen them sing for people's birthday and give them dessert. Their restrooms are really clean too! I mentioned this because I decided that this is a problem that I have with most restaurants that I go to. Their restrooms are usually disgusting and you have to make sure your pants or dress doesn't touch the floor. But their restaurant had very clean bathrooms, and very well decorated too. I have mentioned all of the great things about this restaurant, however there is a reason why I have only given this restaurant four stars. This place is located where there is a whole ton of shopping places, so there are a lot of people that go here, so waiting time could be a long time. On Monday through Thursday, you may be lucky to get a seat within 10- 20 minutes, but if you go on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday around seven, you will be waiting there for a very long time. This restaurant is not the ideal place to go if you are very hungry, you will get very aggravated and annoyed and probably even leave. But once you get your seat everything is great.",4.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I never write a review because I usually have pretty good experiences, especially at Olive Garden. I normally go to the Times Square location with my boyfriend. At this location, the wait was long, 1 hour and 20 minutes but we got in 20 minutes early. When my family and I arrived to our table, I noticed that there were a few tables vacant in the same area, which surprised me especially because the wait was long, you would think was packed inside the restaurant. My experience with the server was horrible, and my family and I will not be coming back to this location. She introduced herself and she came back with a wine asking if we wanted to sample. We declined and ordered our appetizer. Afterwards we ordered our beverage and entree. Our appetizer came with our salad and breadsticks. We finished our beverages right around the time we finished our appetizer. She did not come back until she brought the entrees and collected our appetizer and plates. The mussels in the appetizer and the capellini di mare were overcooked as well. She did not offer or ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks and she has passed by several times while helping the table in front of us. I'm sure she would have noticed that our drink was empty and for more than 20 minutes our original cup was still empty. Normally if a cup was empty or close to empty a server would automatically bring a refill or ask if we wanted a refill. This server did not. She also came 3 times to collect 4 plates because we weren't done at the same time and she still did not bring us a refill. Mind you our beverages were coke and raspberry lemonade, which comes with complementary refills. She asked my family and I if we wanted dessert and we declined. I slowly ate the remaining end of my entree hoping she would bring a drink but she didn't. She came back again and asked if we were sure if we didn't want dessert and gave us the check. We didn't ask for it but when she placed it at our table and then we asked for a refill. She had to ask us what we ordered for our drinks and when she finally brought our drinks, she only brought TWO our of four. We ordered coke and we got DIET coke instead. The whole overall experience was horrible, and will definitely not be coming to this location. I will be going to the Times Square location because even if they are busy they still give good service compared to this location.",1.0,"Located in, Gateway Center",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
3 stars for the food and -1 for the service. Came here w/ my friend and I ordered some pasta w/ grilled chicken. My friend was not that hungry so she ordered soup.

"My fiancee and i are food and service critics. I recently visited Olive Garden on July 6th 2013 and I must say in kind words stay away.  The service is horrible and they ran out of 2 entrees on the menu. We waited 45 minutes to be seated which we understood being that is was the weekend. We were sat and and our waitress Nikeshia C. was the rudest waitress I have ever encountered throughout the many restaurants I have visited. When we asked for the entrees (they ran out off) we also asked what were our choices were pertaining to salad and soup selections and she responded with such a nasty attitude talking down on us; I kept quiet and didn't say anything as I figure she was perhaps just having a bad day. My fiancée ended up ordering a Margarita prior to dinner, 30 minutes went by the waitress Nikeshia returned to the table asking if we wanted to order appetizers by that point we were just ready to order and did advise we were going to pass on the appetizers however when my fiancée asked for the Margarita he ordered 30 minutes prior we were again rudely informed ""you got to wait give the bartender some time to make it"". At this point I am just livid and upset about how rudely this waitress is talking to us, she left the table and came back 5 minutes later with the Margarita which was horrible. We immediately informed her we wanted to just order, it took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive and when it did it was cold---she didn't bother to ask if everything was okay and if steak sauce was needed for the steak my fiancée ordered. The Chicken Marsala I ordered was okay however I was almost done with my meal before she brought my ginger ale drink which I had to remind her of. We finished our dinner and no questions were asked on how everything was. There was no ""have a good night or even come again"". I will never recommend this Olive Garden to any of my friends nor family. I rather pay more and go to the one in Time Square.  I didn't complaint to a manager because I did not want the night to become longer and more upsetting than what It already was, I just won't return.

I was once a big fan of Olive Garden and would frequently visit the location in Times Square. We decided to come to Bay Plaza since it's close by where we live but I'm sad to say that it's changed. The food taste mediocre. Not authentic. I could make pasta at home that taste 100x better. Nobody wants fast food pasta and apps.

"My waitress was nice. The food was okay. I have had better at other locations. My shrimp Alfredo was very oily and the sauce was separating but I was very hungry , so I ate it. In addition , I was charged for a side of spinach but did not know I had to pay extra for it. I don't know if it's just me but I don't think waiters should announce a side to the guest unless it's included in the meal and if they do, they should mention it is an additional cost....It  was only 1.50 extra so I did not say anything but it was presented as if it was included in the meal somehow. Also, not trying to sound cheap with this review but since when does Olive Garden give tiny wine samples ? Everybody knows that when you go to Olive Garden , the waiters should give a nice wine sample so that even if you don't order the wine, you have a nice couple of sips( or is that just me? , please let me know if I'm trifling) .And typically, I give a fatter tip when they do that. The house wine is Roscato , is a 10dollar bottle of wine and I know this because it's one of my favorite cheap wines  . But when I asked for a larger sample, the waiter said that the manager doesn't allow it. (I could have just ordered a glass, but I was already drinking my angry orchard ) Dear manager , you know that entire bottle is ten dollars for the consumer and since you buy wholesale , it's probably 7 or 8 dollars per bottle(the amount we pay for one glass)  stop telling the staff to be cheap with the samples.

"This particular Olive Garden is getting three starts solely for the nice staff.  Now that that's out of the way, let's begin. We had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated here on a Tuesday night. I know people love Olive Garden but that's seems a little crazy. Also you can't roam the rest of the mall because they don't have any sort of system to let you know that your table is ready, other than shouting your name. So you actually have  to sit there and wait to be called. Went to the bathroom and  there was a giant toilet paper monster in one of the stalls. Grosssss.  I also saw that half of the restaurant was entirely empty- made me think that maybe the wait for a table didn't have to be as long. Once we sat the food was ok. It just took such a long time. I know that our waiter was busy, and we did take a while to decide on our order, but there was a minimum of about 8 minutes that passed every time he came over to check on us. And they didn't tell us about deals or items they were out of before hand, so that made the wait to place an order longer. When finally decided on our order- we both wanted the same thing, they told us they were out of the tour of Italy. That's their SIGNATURE dish.  So it took and even longer time to place an order. And their drinks.... don't even bother. The strawberry margarita might as well be virgin and the slush part is not that good. There's also a drink called the Raspberry Mule. DONT DO IT. I was satisfied with my food though and I guess that's what I went there for right ?",3.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I know it's taken me some time to expand on my review from June 18th but life happened and more important things came up. But, here we go...and I write this review because I really like the Olive Garden and I feel that more training is needed at this location (with the manager and wait staff alike). We were called to be seated and walking through the restaurant, my fiancée and I both slipped on food that was on the floor. The restaurant had a hot and musty smell to it...but we decided to stick it out because it was Father's Day. When we were shown to our table, I looked down and there was a mess under our table. And as I looked around all tables had garbage on the floor under them. The restaurant was HOT. And there were oscillating fans stationed in one area that absolutely did not help at all. My utensils were dirty, the ladies room door did not close, and the bathroom was filthy (Dunkin Donut cup was left on the sink, blood on the toilet, messy floors) ...just disgusting. At this point I didn't even want my food. But, again, it was Father's Day... Finally, it's time to order. The waitress did not seem to understand anything that we were saying. Although she did mention that she was new, I still feel like she may have needed more time training. Once our orders were placed, she brought out the salad but did not offer any cheese (which is customary per the Olive Garden brand) and the salad had no onions. This may seem minor, but again as it relates to the Olive Garden brand it is not minor at all. So, we're eating salad but yet still had to wait an hour for our food to come. When we complained about it all we got were apologies so at that point we asked to meet with the manager. At the time that the manager was coming, so was our food. We were a party of 6 and only 3 of the orders were right. The manager personally put in the correct orders, served them to us, and gave us free dessert for our troubles. Finally, as we were done with everything, another waitress cleared the table for us because ours disappeared...which we later saw that she was outside smoking...we walked right past her. I made it a point to let the manager know that the establishment needed a lot of work. I directed his attention to the mess on the floors (that he walked by several times and didn't have anyone clean it). I've never had to do a bad review about any Olive Garden. I love the restaurant chain. But, this location has to be the absolute worst. After this experience, I feel that management and staff could benefit from additional training. Also, while it may seem minor, we weren't even given mints. We had to get them at the front desk. I've been to many Olive Gardens and that isn't common. I'm only giving this place 1 star because it's required.",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Hadn't gone to an Olive Garden in ages. Was walking around the mall at Bay Plaza and stopped in for a snack. The food is ok, around a 3.5 but the service was very nice. Our waitress was very friendly and patient with us. She also offered a free wine tasting and didn't make a push for us to buy. For a chain restaurant, the food and service wasn't bad. We enjoyed our meal there. Of note, they have monitors at every table where you can place orders, call for your server, play games, or pay for your check. Very convenient. I imagine if you have kids, the games would be great for entertaining the kids so that the adults can eat.",4.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I not the type to really criticize food and restaurants but Olive Garden in Bay Plaza has horrible service. We walk in and they ask us to wait for 10 minutes while all of the servers are gathered at the host desk talking s**t about customers. They seat us at a dirty table and we sat there for about 30 minutes. On our way out we told the manager that we were leaving because another table got served before us and we were asked to stay because ""we got you"".

We had to wait another 40 minutes for a waiter to come just for him to say ""this isn't my section but what do you want to order?""  It was freezing inside of the restaurant which was causing our soups to get cold.  Smh wtf!!!!

"I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all. However, if I had to compare this Olive Garden to others that I've been to it defiantly isn't the best but I guess it wasn't all that bad. First off, I usually love their bread sticks but the bread here was really hard and crunchy, I didn't even want more after tasting it. The croutons on the salad were also really bad, for some reason it tasted like it was the very last bits of croutons they had or something. Also, usually at most Olive Garden I've been to they  ask if you'd prefer salad or soup but we were never asked, we just received the salad. I also noticed this for the other tables as well, I'm not sure if this has changed or if they just don't give you the option at this Olive Garden for some reason. For appetizer we got the shrimp scampi Frieda, I ordered my usual chicken scampi and my boyfriend got the lasagna, our food was good so I have no complaints there. As for service, our waiter was good, the only thing was my boyfriends drink did take a bit long to come out and for some reason he never took the menu off the table after we ordered.",3.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I was actually saying okk this is actually nice for a Bronx chain establishment. I forgot our waitress name but she was lovely and very accommodating Food was decent I mean it is a chain restaurant. Of course the bread sticks and salad are always good lol- dont forget those free refills hahaha I may return here but only on off peak hours. BTW the mall was also clean and nice, So were the bathrooms. I was a lil impressed. The BX tends to get a bad rap alot of times and I can see why but on this day it was free of ridiculousness from what I gathered.Maybe because it was off peak hours?

"I'm rating this restaurant one star, because this is the minimum. Last night, my boyfriend and I went to Olive Garden located in the Bay Plaza mall around 10PM. The restaurant was nearly empty and we were seated quickly. The booth where we sat was extremely dirty. There were wrappers & tissues on the floor and on top of the booth. It took about 15 mins to be served. The server, Jose, quickly gave an excuse saying that he was servicing the bar area (mind you, it was nearly empty). He then said he ran out of paper to take orders. We ordered two drinks and water, but also our soups and entrees. On top of that, his breath smelled foul and down right gave me a headache. Also, he never went to get the paper and took our orders on some type of cardboard. Another 20 mins went by, and I didn't receive my drink. Jose then said that they ran out of the drink and wanted to suggest another drink. I ordered Angry Orchard. A few more mins went by and then two soups came, but not the one I ordered- it was the same soup my boyfriend ordered. When I said this wasn't the soup I ordered, Jose said that they also ran out of the soup but I could take the soup home and that we weren't going to be charged. When he suggested that he would ask the chefs to see if the soup could be made, I said yes please do that. He then in turn said that it was too late. In addition, Jose asked if I knew Spanish and then proceeded to say that potatoes & salchichon look better than what it sounds. Our entrees came, which were served by someone else. We had to ask to be served grated cheese, which the server never came. The food was obviously over cooked and practically burned. It was about 20 minutes later that the breadsticks finally came, along with my soup. Jose then says that we can get extra breadsticks to take home, along with another soup. We politely declined as we just wanted to finish our food and go home. Jose walked by us at least four times without addressing us, but also apologizing to fellow customers and giving them the same excuses. We ordered desert, which was another problem. At this point, Jose had an attitude and tried to instruct me how to use the kiosk. I ordered the desert, which seemed to look really good. However, the desert was hard and burned. We didn't receive our waters until after we asked for the third time. Jose said he would offer raspberry lemonade instead- for free, on the house- his exact words. My boyfriend still wanted water and he tried to shame my boyfriend for wanting water- raspberry lemonade is better than water- his exact words. When we asked for the check, Jose kept asking if we were okay and ready. We paid the check, in which Jose then went and tried to see if we paid him a tip- in front of us nonetheless. At this point, I really wanted to leave. Between hearing the bar staff talking about how they want to work at Outback Steak House, the bad service, and Jose's nasty breath, it's safe to say that I won't be back at Olive Garden's Bay Plaza location for a very long time, if ever. I'll just stick to Olive Garden's Chelsea location. It's a shame how these people treat their customers and this is one of the reasons why the Bronx has such a bad reputation.",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"The staff here pretty much carry the same attitude. The person who greets you, the other person who seats you, and the person who brings in the food did not care much for someone who is paying to be there. People at the front desk pretend to not notice when people arrive and have you wait there until they feel like acknowledging you. It was our anniversary so I brought my girlfriend here thinking that this place would be one of the few good places to eat at here at Bay Plaza. Our waiter Alex attended us well, but forgot to bring us breadsticks until I reminded him towards the end so for the service I give 4 stars. The lady who brought out the appetizers carelessly dropped the plate in front of me and even startled the table sitting next to us from the noise. That's fine. Probably in a bad mood so I chose not to say anything to her and instead spoke with the waiter. Proceeding to eat , I was disappointed that the appetizers were microwaved, as were the entrees because the plates were piping hot with the food unevenly hot throughout. Why pay good money for microwaved food? I'd recommend the Outback Steakhouse instead which is right downstairs.",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"First time going to this establishment in general and it was...well, it just was. The food was okay and those much talked about breadsticks were fine. As for this actual location: Yes it was a rush Saturday and in a very popular area but the hostesses at the front should maintain their organization much better. That's kind of their job. Our waiter was okay but it started off on a bad foot because again the hostess trying to rectify a mistake placed us in a wrong section (e.g. we asked for a high chair multiple times get taken to a booth where again we say we need space for a chair ""oh we'll stick it in a corner that's fine"" come the waiter and he's like ""we can't have a chair here"" we ended up staying in the section and with the chair but regardless, lack of communication, direction, organization, I don't know what. I don't expect much honestly I just expect cordial people directing me where I should accurately go. Then we didn't have any menus or napkins at the table until a good ten minutes or anything I don't know it was just very much a mess at first. Finally the food was fine and our waiter was nice. I want to blame the frazzled members on the crazy Saturday rush in fact a lot of reticence in returning is due to that and crowd but I just think a little more effort in organization and managing could be helpful.",2.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Updated review- 5/9/2017 - My expectations were very high for my second visit to this location Olive Garden in bay plaza, and my first visit here was amazing!! But now this location went down the tubes and the last time I was here was a month ago. I come back today with my family and it was a nightmare! What happened?? Here is what went wrong today at Olive Garden- 1. A fight broke down between two employees started in the front and went into the kitchen area and the two cursed and screamed like two animals from the bronx zoo. We are not here to watch an argument between the two, we are here to eat and have a good peaceful night. Why do they have to hire such lousy ass employees that don't want to work here? The other employees laughed and kept watching and posting it on Snapchat or Instagram and did nothing about it. It disturbed our meal time and we didn't even get the chance to get our food yet and after I saw that fight, I told my family to eat somewhere else because we had children with us. I thought that since I had a good time last month here at Olive Garden, maybe the second time could be a charm but not this time. Instead we had to watch a freakin circus against the employees and no one is there to break it up. 2. Since the employees were watching the fight, no one was there to give us our table until 25 minutes later. Un real!! 3. Because of all of this, me and my family left and went for Red Robin downstairs and it was better. I am not coming back here again and I had high hopes for a second time but I guess it was too good to be true!!! Un freaking believable!!!",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I am amazed to see the low scores that some have given to this establishment. I went for lunch today and had a truly wonderful experience.   I spoke with the Manager - Valerie who is a really personable individual - caring and very much in charge of her people.   The overall atmosphere was professional, the dining room clean and the the food was excellent and VERY hot.  (I love when plates are heated before serving.) I had one of the best waitresses - Keisha.  The dining room filled up quickly at lunch and you could see that most people would be overwhelmed at the number of people coming in at one time.  Keisha took matters into her hands and commanded a presence and efficiency.  She was GREAT and everyone was truly happy. When there is an issue of any kind, I wish that customers would ask for the manager.   I know individuals like Valerie or the general manager - Jorge are excellent to their word and will do anything/everything to accommodate the guests they serve.   I know that these two managers have taken over recently and are making tremendous strides in employee training and hiring. I know this restaurant can only get better and as evidenced by today's meal - you are making GREAT things happen.",5.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

But the place was a mess, we arrived at 7:45pm and didn't get our dinner until 10pm. I felt bad for our waitress because she was running around to some many other tables and it seemed as though they were short staff which was the same issue we had the first time.

And my experience was just that fast, mediocre and under whelming. The only thing that may have been decent was the salad (which a two year old could probably get right), stuffed mushrooms and the Spicy Shrimp Scampi Fritta. The Pappardelle Pescatore was lacking enuff seafood as projected on the menu and very under seasoned. The fried calamari wasn't that fried which is sad when my local pizzeria can do a better job.....its calamari folks not that hard to fry up.

"This past weekend, I took my mom out for her birthday at Olive Garden. It was the first time there for us. The environment and waiter were all nice but I wasn't satisfied with my food. The salad, bread sticks, and soup taste good; but when I got my lobster ravioli, I was disappointed. The shrimp had this very high odor coming from it as if it was cleaned properly and the ravioli itself was on the stiff side and very rubbery. I was not pleased with this at all and for the money I spent there I believe much better food should have been served. Another thing that bothered me a lot was that a waitress there kept asking over and over if we wanted to sample their wine and over and over I kept telling her that we don't drink. I don't understand what was so difficult to grasp about that.",2.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"The Olive Garden is a place for very fresh food, including tasty salads, delicious soups, and a large variety of pasta combinations. I like that you have the option of creating your own dish...pasta, topping sauce and protein. The place is furnished beautifully for a restaurant that is truly reasonable. Best to come at off-hours when service and seating is more relaxed. I come here after shopping at the mall.

The waitress was forgetful about our drinks but was very apologetic so if made up for it. Now the negatives: the FOOD was mediocre. Like I could've stayed home and tried the dishes myself and probably have done a better job... and I can't cook, lol. Seriously I think Olive Garden can step up their game when it comes to Italian food. My mother who is an excellent cook left the restaurant disappointed as she expected good food.

"If you have any food allergies/intollerances skip this place. I don't tolerate gluten which is a very common (10% of population Im told) problem so you would think most restaurants would know how to deal with this. The OG menu says they can substitute the regular pasta with gluten free pasta so that makes you think they know what they are doing. NOT! Since I was told that non of the non pasta dishes where gluten free I assumed the pasta dishes made with gluten free pasta would be. Just to be sure I asked the server to check with the kitchen. Turns out that the sauces are all made with gluten. Seems a bit deceitful to me to offer people to substitute regular pasta with gluten-free pasta only to drown the gluten free pasta in sauce with gluten. I than picked the only food that was explicitly called gluten free: gluten free pasta with marinara sauce and grilled chicken. (of the whole menu this was the only gluten free dish!) The sauce was just some canned tomato's heated up but what's worse is that in some of that so called gluten free food there must have been gluten because I woke up in serious pain this morning. And from the severity I know that it will take at least a week to subside and that there must have been a significant amount of gluten in the food I ate. I don't have problems with cross-contamination. For me to get sick there has to be a significant amount of gluten in the food. Even though I made it clear to the server that I don't tolerate gluten the salad came covered with croutons, so I had to skip that. I understand that for the chef or a restaurant people with food intolerance are a nuisance but if you cant handle it, make it clear, don't present a menu with gluten free options if they aren't gluten free!  On top of that my son just wanted a pasta with cheese. He never got the cheese. I was also offered cheese for my dish but never got it. The only reason im not giving one star is because the service was quick, the kids enjoyed playing with the ipad on the table and the low price (needles to say I would happily have paid more for a meal that would not have left me in pain!)",2.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Disappointed with this Olive Garden. The server was nice but didn't know the menu well and was not very professional. Not to mention I barely saw her. She forgot I countless amount of things. It seemed she had 3 tables which shouldn't be terrible to juggle. My food was bland but I can't expect much from a chain restaurant. I didn't eat much of my entree because I was filled up on my appetizers so I brought it home. The next day I noticed a moldy tomato in my pasta. I was disgusted.

My request was ignored. - We ordered a Ginger Ale and a Stella. The server returns 10 mins later stating they are currently out of both. WHA?! - Food came. We both ordered Chicken with Fettuccine. Hers was fine. Mine? A long, black, thick strand of hair wrapped around a piece of pasta. I asked for the check right away and pointed out the hair. The waiter said the manager would be right over...guess what, he/she never showed. -Check came with the ""pasta with hair"" taken off, BUT I was charged for the beer and soda which they ""ran out of."" The check had to be redone with that taken off. PROS - finally leaving Unreal! This is EXACTLY WHY, people that live outside the borough do not respect the Bronx.

I told her that if our table gets one serving of salad and breadsticks, since we ordered one entree, why should she care which person at the table ordered it. The manager just looked at me with a puzzled look and was unable to explain to me the reason for this rule.

It had to be the shrimp.  I proceeded to contact olive garden and spoke with Dwayne, who proceeded to tell me that any food borne illness takes 24hrs to show effect.  In other words it was not the shrimp, I'm sorry but if you just ate something and something did not agree with you then you are going to throw up.  He took all my info and then I received a call from the insurance company, they asked if he went to the doctor and if any medical bills insued.  I responded no, because he threw it all up and felt better after he did that.  I heard nothing else from the insurance company or Dwayne not even an offer to refund his part of the meal.  I will never eat here again or advise anyone else to eat here, I would much rather eat at the olive garden on 42nd st.",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Where is the service??? We ended up calling the restaurant to speak with the manager and avoid making a scene from right outside and were put on hold for 10 minutes while the host conversed with fellow workers.

The table then was decent. Our food was not very satisfying our drinks were watery and the waitress was very absent. We practically said we would never go there again. BUT!!! Recently we decided to give Bay plaza's Olive Garden one more chance. And my I say KEISHA KEISHA KEISHA !!! Omg! She was great!!!! Everything literally was great!!! My fiancé and son was very satisfied. Ask for Keisha!!,5.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Where do I begin , a coworker and I came to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch at the bar. The bar was a mess , still with previous order from before us. Tables had dirty dishes laying around. The waitress at the bar didn't greet us till 10 min after we have been sitting. She then greeted us after we had said something to another employee.  She never apologized for the wait and just said "" what can I get you today?"".. basically the service was horrible and I will never go again .

"at first this restaurant feels so cozy... then you get to the reception. apparently the Latin servers are offended to be Latin. just saying, my personal experience at the reception, no smiles, just a sharp and intolerable attitude. then we waited for any sign of a server, after the unwelcoming entry. we waited, then waited some more. finally a very nice young lady came to serve us, and although she was very kind, we still waited more.. until after finishing our meal, to get our margarita -- (I know, my mom, it was good!) decor is nice, feels good for family. service and food portions lack. but the added venue at the mall is refreshing nonetheless. thebronxhunter",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

This is the worst experience I've had at an Olive Garden location ever... Three different waiters came and took the order for my table and each waiter was unaware that someone else had taken the order... We ordered drinks from the happy hour menu and one of the drinks was god awful after one sip the waitress stated that there was nothing she could do about the drink it has already been served talk about customer service...the food arrived cold and at this point I was just ready to go because of its location in the new indoor bay plaza mall it's always packed and you better have a good nice comfy seat because the wait to even get the table is atrocious..,1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I like Olive Garden in general. The food and drinks are good, they have ample seating space, and they have a good kids menu. When we travel if there is an Olive Garden close-by we definitely go there. Some places seem busier than others. We went here Sunday afternoon after our visit to the New York Botanical Garden, it is 5 miles and 15 minutes away inside a mall. The restaurant had lots of empty tables at 1pm and we were seated immediately. The mediterranean flatbread and house salad are delicious, I could have just eaten that and it was enough, we didn't need entrees. My kids liked their salad and hot garlic bread. The pasta was okay, it felt a bit bland. My kids are used to more flavor, as am I, so the sauce felt a bit light. The flatbread was delicious, I really liked the flavor. They have a specific sparkling white wine which is on the sweeter side, I forgot the name, it is delicious! Very sweet, unlike regular wine, and yummy. Their non-alcoholic options are quite good. Portions are large enough for 2-4 people. Service was okay. The server didn't understand our order when we asked for substitutions and made a couple of mistakes but he didn't charge for it. They have kiosks on tables which makes it confusing. Sometimes they do substitutions that cannot be entered on the kiosk, beverages are also not on the kiosk, so it is confusing for the server because he/she has to write some things down and walk us through some items on the kiosk. That is why our order got messed up. The kiosk is efficient for standard orders, and you pay and get your receipt right there, and fill a survey about your waiter right there which is good and efficient. I just felt that maybe the survey may make the servers a bit insecure. By all means we should voice our opinion on bad service and complain, but sometimes it affects their means of livelihood especially if the customer is obnoxious and it is not the server's fault. Overall the service wasn't the best. Items for the kids came out last, usually it is the opposite because parents cannot eat till kids can. The sides also came out before their food. I think because of confusion while placing the order the server didn't understand that we needed the kids meal rather than separate items, so he brought fries first. My kids were waiting hungrily for pasta but when the side of fries came first that is all they ate, and the side of Broccoli that came after was left untouched! All in all, we had a very good meal, very delicious, but it would help if the place was a bit more organized in taking orders and bringing out meals. I still give it 4 stars because the meal is very good and service is better without the attitude you see sometimes in Manhattan.",4.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Pasta was just ok, nothing to die for & they didn't give me extra sauce like I asked! Also when it's busy they can't not handle the rush & took forever & a day just to bring us the food! Unlimited bread, don't make me laugh try limited bread! Terrible! Only thing that was worth having was the salad! Since this is the land of second chances I may give them one more chance to get it right but that is it!

"Went here in January with my parents and it was a complete nightmare. And I went in here with the LOWEST of expectations, knowing it was like a McDonald's of Italian food. I went in and learned saying that is actually an insult to McDonald's Our waitress asked if we would like to try their ""house wine."" We tried it but didn't like it and ordered different wine. She seemed offended for some reason, First we order our drinks which take 10-15 minutes, and the breadsticks also take a long time. to come out. That's one thing but wine shouldn't take as long. We have two sticks of butter for three people, tell the waitress and get back two sticks of butter. WTF? Four sticks of butter for three people? The only saving grace was our appetizer, the fried calamari was ""decent"" and the Dumpling Soup was good, and probably the best thing I had. Then for the main course I had the trio with the chicken parmigiana, fettucini alfredo, and I forgot what the third thing was, I think it was scampi, obviously not memorable. Worst chicken parmigiana I ever tasted. It was basically breaded chicken with a little bit of cheese on top.  No flavor, The pasta was edible. At least I know next time (if there is a next time to order pasta, I'd think long and hard before going back to Olive Garden at this particular location though). Then dessert, we order coffee, and get tea. We tell the waitress who goes back, comes back and tells us they have to brew a pot. So the night began in disaster and ended in disaster. A complete nightmare. I know shows like ""Bar Rescue"" and ""Kitchen Nightmares"" don't normally do chain restaurants but they really need to look into this location. Also, me and my parents are usually 20 percent tippers no matter what- if we didn't like the food- not their fault. Uninspired service usually gets 15 percent since they still technically did their job. (we pretty much have to be cursed out to tip less than 15) We don't go lower than that. My father, against my advice, gave the waitress 20 percent, saying he felt it was management's fault and not her's for the fiasco. (In other words, he gave her a good tip out of pity for her having to work there.) I felt we should gave her 15 percent since whether the place was a hellhole or not there were some common sense things- like putting two measly sticks of butter on a table for three people. However, reading the review's below, it seems my father was right after all for giving her the benefit of the doubt and management did not train her properly, and they are primarily responsible for what seems a lot of Yelpers bad experience. It's the Olive Garden. I wasn't expecting it to be a Zagat-rated restaurant. But I also was expecting decent service and edible food.  We got a kitchen nightmare and barely edible food.",1.0,"200 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY 10475",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

When I asked how did was it cooked the second time around the waitress said in the microwave.WTH!!!!. I ordered chicken scampi and it was friggin bland and dry. We also order steak with shrimps and asked the steak be cooked medium rare lol and it was cooked dry as in over cooked and bland. We ordered two bottles of moscato and was over charged.  To top things off one of our water pitchers had food floating in it. We spoke to a manager and we obviously were upset after three separate let downs in our lunch. She said to us "" What is wrong with you?

Waited nearly 30 minutes for a server to finally take an order. This location is going to compromise the Olive Garden reputation. I saw a female leave in tears (at the incompetence). Where is management? Did they conduct training before opening? At best, retraining is an absolute necessity.  Based on the ineptitude, it must be an attitude of total indifference. Who sets the tone? Management. They better start respecting the Bronx patron and those Bronx dollars before it is too late. Or worse, still are they of the opinion that in the Bronx customer service doesn't matter? If they think the latter will fly, they are severely mistaken. You want to be tipped at 20% or better, it is not going to happen with this level of service.

We was seated after 45mins wait. The waiter got us water to begin with. There 8 of us. 7 cups of water. And only 4 had straws. I asked for an extra cup of water. That didn't come until I finished my dinner entree. Oh and I'm pretty sure the water they gave me, there was something wrong with it ; cause it tasted like bathroom sink water. With an awful after taste. ( I even compared it with the other cup given to us- oh yeah big difference in taste) Then they messed up on the soup they gave me the wrong one that didn't come til I was ready to pay for dinner. We asked for straws that took 5 tries. We asked for plates with the salad that took 2. We shouldn't need to ask for proper fork/knives setting. We should need to ask for proper straws to go with proper number of cups. We shouldn't need to ask more than 2 times in a time management of 2 hours. If your understaffed, hire more people. The quantity of employees has effected this business's quality services. And the food was even more bothering. My paste was undercook. The salad had no salad dressing.

"I don't know why this Olive Garden has a low rating. I enjoyed my experience here and had no complaints! The first thing I thought before trying this location was ""hot mess"" ! Being that it's near green acres I expected the worse but I was wrong. I went during the week on a Wednesday midday where it wasn't too crowded and we were seated and served right away. Our server was pleasant and didn't seem forced to be nice just for a tip. I ordered the small tri colored pasta bowl which was ok. The salad was nice and fresh and for the first time I tried calamari and actually really enjoyed it. They even have a mini tablet attached to the table so that you can sign up for the club and also pay. I love this place and I definitely will be coming back,",5.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"The worst Italian food we've ever had. My wife ordered a steak cooked medium. It came out extra-we'll done. It was so hard she couldn't cut through it with a steak knife. I had Tuscany soup that was so full of salt I had to return it. Then I had chicken parmigiana which was so salty I couldn't eat it. I don't know why they cook with so much salt. I paid for our two glasses of wine and walked out, vowing never to return. I asked to speak to a manager and was told no manager was available. This was a horrible dining experience.

I ordered the Tucson steak medium, it came to me rare. I ask the waiter to please fix this. He took it and the useless cook instead of cooking a new steak decides to fry mine more.

"Bottom Line: The food's just okay...but the service is ""mane hol up"" *houston accent. I would avoid this place because they let the service ruin an already mediocre experience. Tipping: I was a waitress for a while and because of that I'm really big on giving a good base tip no matter what. This was the first time I didn't leave a tip- why? The girl  (Paris) didn't leave us ANY change. After that, I went up to her and told her that she didn't leave change so we couldn't leave a tip. Her response: OH THATS FINE- and walks off... What? I mean cool, I get to save some money, but that kind of spoke for the overall experience. Service: I kept trying to give the girl the benefit of the doubt. People have a bad day, something goes wrong, their tired etc. She was really clearly ready to leave- okay, cool. Then that tip fiasco happened and it was a wrap for me. Food: Olive Garden food that's less than basic. The salad was really good though. The few breadsticks that we did get (because I didn't bother to follow up with the fact that they were supposed to bring us more) were good. Just don't go here LOL.",2.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

It wasn't a great experience from the beginning, waiting for our host to be yelled at by a tall woman with a Caribbean accent (about another guest who apparently lost their keys) before taking our names to be seated.

Our server Ricky was super personable. Great customer service, friendly, he gave food/drink suggestions and really seemed like he wasn't just being nice for a tip -- I mean he totally could have been, but we bought it. I so appreciate that he was honest about a hiccup with our bill that caused us to wait 20 minutes longer than we would have preferred.

Lol I haven't been to Olive Garden in like three years and I remember the Shrimp Alfredo tasting much better, it used to be my favorite meal of all time.

I said I'm waiting for someone and it would be about 20 minutes before they arrived. the hostess said she could not seat me yet, which doesn't make sense when the dining room was barely half full. I had to insist that I was going to order drinks and an appetizer as I wait before she could give me a table. Terrible. The waitress was nice. I ordered their Bellini peach tea. although it barely had any ice in it (as a restaurant, you always want to give a fair amount of ice if you serve freshly brewed WARM tea) but it was tasty so I didn't mind too much. I ordered their spicy shrimp scampi fritters and after about a 10 minute wait, I'm told they're out. Ok. Fine. I order the stuffed mushrooms and they are out of those as well! Obviously this wasn't the waitresses fault but for a weekday afternoon you'd expect them to be a little prepared. I ordered the calamari for a quick bite, canceled my lunch date, and kept it moving.

Let me start off by saying we usually like eating at Olive Garden although this was the first time we visited this particular restaurant.  We arrived as a party of 4 and were told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait.  We could see there were about 20 tables empty.  We were finally seated in about ten minutes at a small booth.  We asked if we could sit at the  table next to the booth which had more room.  We were again told we had to wait even thought there were still many tables empty.  We were finally seated and ordered out food and drinks. Our appetizer and salad came quickly but at the same time.  The salad had items we had asked to be left out and our drink order was wrong.  As we began to eat the app and salad our dinners came out.  We quickly ate our app and salad and started on our dinners.  The entire time we sat there we could see three waitresses in the corner texting on their phones and we could also see people waiting to be seated even thought there were at least 15 tables empty.  I can say the food was pretty good and our server was friendly but there rest of our experience was terrible. We will not return to this restaurant.,1.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Food was good....service was horrible ..waiter was very inattentive.

"Worst Damn restaurant I've ever ate at, EVER!!!!!!!!.This server came up to me with such a bad attitude, it was pathetic.When i was ordering the chicken parmigiana she said that i pronounce it wrong and she was like ""Okay Sir (rudely), its fucking chicken parmesan"".Her and her nasty attitude can go shove it.When she brought the appetizers she just tossed it on the table without a care in the world. The food was greasy, the soda was flat, the portions for the entrees were way to big, no wonder its set for 1,400 calories.The pasta for entree was bland, and the chicken tasted frozen and a bit underdone, it was too damn chewy.

I went for lunch on Sunday to Olive Garden. They told me it would be a 15 minute wait due to the fact that there staff did not check in yet at 12:30 in the afternoon. What a lame excuse that was.

"I've been to the Olive Garden on 6th Avenue and 23rd street in Manhattan. I had a very, very good dining experience there. The food and the service were excellent! So I can't figure out why this branch allowed their standards to slip to the point, where they are at risk of getting shut down by the board of heath? First of all, the floors in the area where I was seated (front to the bar) was littered with dirty sugar packets and drinking straw wrappings spewed all over the floor and the floor had not seen a clean mop in weeks. You had to be totally blind not to notice it. The men's bathroom was beyond filthy--the toilets was overflowing with human waste. The salmon dish I had was pathetic. It tasted like a frozen TV dinner left in a microwave oven for too long.  My mom had pasta with chicken meatballs. She said the meatballs didn't taste like chicken and pasta sauce was bland. Oh, and last but not least, a table right next to ours found a roach crawling across their table. I spent at least $50.00 including tip.  One good thing(s) about this place  was that the waitress and server were professional and courteous. However, I felt truly ripped off.

Now people..when u come here you are aware that you're not having a three course meal at a Mario Batali Food Network dinner.  It is what it is.

I arrived at 6:30PM on a Saturday and the lobby was packed with people waiting to be seated. The hostess told me it was going to be a half hour wait so I decided to walk around Michael's while I was waiting and within 15 minutes, the buzzer went off so I ran back. I finished dinner around 8PM and there was a good amount of tables around us that were empty. When I was passing through the lobby to leave, it was still packed with people waiting to be seated and I overheard the hostess tell someone the wait was going to be an hour.

"Lets get to the obvious.  This is not your mother homecooked  Italian meals.  Your food will not look like the commercial or the menu. This location is going to get a wide variety of partons that may not know what a good dining experience is supposed to be.  Now...past the disclaimer. The decor is lovely. There is not enough seating in the waiting area but that is to be expected.  The ambiance is nice but it can get a little loud due to the constant traffic at this busy location.  The audience may affect your experience so try to ignore it.  I have seen kids running around tables, rawkus laughter, drunken grandmas and sloppy wait staff just to name a few. Salad and breadsticks are always good. Depending on when you go, food may be out in 10 minutes or 50 minutes.  Drinks in all of these establishments are meant to give the appearance of real alcohol...not the effects. Get a drink to compliment your meal.  If you want alcohol, stick with a beer in a frosty mug.  Stay away from spirits since they are watered down. I have not had a problem with the wait staff.  Once, our waiter was alittle too comfortable with us but he catered to our demands with no problems.  Another time, we had a young waitress that was running around like a mad person so we took it easy on her.  She replaced our silverware and refilled our drinks without us asking. So why 2 stars?  The food was tasteless.  Marinara sauces lacked flavor.  Cream sauces were oily. Steak was over cooked and pasta was rubbery.  This is the chef's fault.  Messing up on one dish is a timing thing....messing up everyone's dish is an incompetent thing. If you are in the neighborhood and want real Italian food, drive 5 more minutes into Lynbrook and go to Angelina's on Atlantic Avenue between Sunrise and Merrick Road.",2.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Omg! Where do I start..  I'm gonna start by saying that my visit to this restaurant yesterday, was the worst experience ever at a restaurant!! I went with family members to celebrate a birthday. It was 15 of us. It felt like we was in a television show ""Restaurant Impossible"" checking out a restaurant going out of business. They started us of with samples of wine. The wine glasses that was brought to us, were straight of the dish washer, the waiter told us so. They were wet and warm. After a while I order a Long Island ice tea. I was told by the waiter that it was a strong drink. I said no problem. I like it like that. So I get the drink and it just tasted like water!! Another member of the family order Hennessy which it was water down! Nothing like what they should of been. I didn't bother trying any other drink. Now with the food. What a disaster! We got are food in different times! We had mixed up orders. One of us got the food so late that she just told the waiter to wrap it to go. The birthday girl was the last one to get her food! I order steak that  was a disappointment, specially for what it cost. They divided our table in to two. What was that for! It was chaos. Maybe it would of been better with one waiter. Could of avoid some confusion maybe. One of the waiters just wonder off. By the time the one good waiter try to do the right thing for us, it was too late. So manny bad already had happened.  We was so busy thinking of all that had happened on our table, that we even forgot to ask for a manager. I thought about not even going to this restaurant because the bad reviews already on here but decided to give it chance anyways. I regret it. Specially that all this happened when we went to celebrate a birthday. It was suppose to of have been a special night. What a waste of money!

"Like someone else has said.. I love Olive Garden, but not this one. I had a disappointing experience this Friday evening for dinner. What went wrong: - I ordered an Italian Margarita (my usual beverage of choice when I eat here) I know that it always comes with two cocktail straws and a shot on the side. I didn't receive either of these items but shrugged it off no big deal. - Breadsticks were dropped off with our drinks but we didn't have any of the small plates (which they usually provide) to set the bread down on, kind of inconvenient especially because, without a straw, I'll need my hands free to take a drink. I'll shrug this one off too. - I asked if I could sub a side Caesar salad for the house salad with my meal. She brought out a HUGE chicken Caesar salad which I couldn't eat (I'm not able to eat meat). I had to send it back to get the side Caesar salad I ordered. -Within 2 minutes of getting my correct salad order we got our entrees. Both of us got Fettuccine Alfredo, which we ordinarily love, but this time they were really skimpy with the sauce. Some of our noodles didn't have any sauce on them at all. -The waitress came to check to see how everything was when we informed her that we had never received our appetizer, she assured us that it would be out any second. -She came to check on us ten minutes later and at this point I had finished my salad and was just starting on my -now cold- pasta. My date had finished his pasta and we were STILL waiting for our appetizer. The waitress told us that the appetizer ""is taking so long because the items are fried"", not exactly sure how to respond to that... -Five MORE minutes and we finally get our appetizer (which was a tiny bit undercooked but I don't mind too much because at this point I know I'll be taking it home and re-heating it for lunch tomorrow) What went well: -We were seated right away at 5:30pm on a Friday. If any one or two of those things had happened alone, I wouldn't have cared as much but the fact that it was just one disappointment after another, influenced my decision to write this review. Hope it's helpful! I'll be avoiding this dinner option for date night in the future.",2.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"This is the worst Olive Garden I've ever been to and I will never go back. Let me preface by saying that the servers were VERY nice. The issue was in the kitchen and with management. We waited over an hour for our food (it was not packed, in fact, there were several empty seats in our section). After that, a manager came over, fumbling over his words and apologizing for the delay. Then he said he would be back with an update. We waited another ten minutes. Still no manager. The servers kept coming back over, trying their best to be accommodating but were obviously stuck between a rock and a hard place. Finally, we had to ask for the manager again. He came back out, mumbling that they would pay for our meals and was willing to pack it up if we wanted to go. We waited. And waited. And finally, after 90 minutes of salad and breadsticks with little communication, we left. Again, I must say, the servers are nice and I felt really bad for them.

"I like Olive Garden. Unfortunately, I do not like THIS Olive Garden. The Good: * wait time was only ten minutes on a Sunday evening * our server, Eric, was sweet- not very attentive, but sweet * salad and breadsticks were on par * the manager comped our two entrees so dinner was $6 before tip The Bad: * took at least 20 minutes to get our drink order taken * never got those drinks refilled.... * the main reason for 2 star review- the food was tasteless.  I got the Spicy Shrimp Vesuvio- it wasn't spicy...or any flavor.  The pasta was bland, the shrimp were the size of quarters and tasted fishy.  I am definitely NOT a picky eater and I just couldn't eat this.  I took a few bites, added salt, pepper, and sugar and took a few more bites then stopped.  My boyfriend got the crispy Parmesan shrimp- his shrimp were tasty but the accompanying pasta with cream sauce was bland so he ate the shrimp and stopped there.  We normally don't complain but when Eric asked if everything was ""good"" we told him not really.  Then something odd came out if his mouth- he laughed and asked, ""are you by any chance Italian.""  Ummmm.....I can only assume he thought we were being harsh on the meal because it isn't authentic Italian (which we aren't anyway, proving his point to be moot).  So we said no and explained why the dishes weren't so great. He was cool and got the manager, who took forever to get back to us, but in the end who also struck the entrees from the bill (after offering to pack our meals to go....ummm....prolly not gonna taste any better at home but thanks) So...food sucked but they remedied the situation fairly well.  We probably won't be going back.",2.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Came for a late night food crave. I ordered for a pickup. The service was excellent: my food was ready and the girls at the front were very pleasant. The only negative and unpleasant part of my experience was that the manager or shift supervisor came from the back scolding one of the girls for a mistake she made. It seems she took an order over the phone and forgot to write down the customers telephone number. Now it was closing time and the customer couldn't be contacted. I understand the dilemma this may present to the business but as a paying customer (and the only customer at the front at the time) I do not need to know what happens behind the curtains of the business nor the unprofessional manner employees are treated. The managers behavior towards her employee made me feel uncomfortable and made the experience awkward for me. That is why, although I love the food, I took one star off from my review.

Although I told her at the begining I was in lunch brake, she obviously didn't care, for the bill I had to get up and look for her, she was not in the room were the waitresses are so i was ready to walk in the kitchen to find her, when she finally showed up i gave her the money then she said do you want the change I said yes!! Then i calculate and the change was about 20 % so i said it's ok keep the change. She really deserve 10%,  better yet 0% for the agrevation, It was a nightmare, next time i will go to red lobster next door, where i only had good experiences. I guess this waitress knows that the free soup and salad won't increase her tip. ....my opinion is ""she doesn't care about the customers.""",1.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"I'm sorry to do this but after several attempts at a decent meal this location hasn't given me ""life"" like other places. In short, I've been here on 4 different occasions. 1st trip my cousin raved about some pasta steak dish. I ordered a simple chicken Alfredo dish that came out completely cold with no Alfredo sauce. So cold that it left my waitress speechless.  2nd attempt left me with dry pasta (yet again) and cold minestrone soup. The purpose of soup is to get something warm in your tummy, no?! 3rd time, we waited for our meal for an obscenely amount of time. Let me point out that this was during the lunch seating. Food was less than mediocre. And today 2/17 I played it safe with a herbed salmon with a side of broccoli. Salmon was just ok but the broccoli looked like it was left in the bottom of the produce draw in the refrigerator for a few weeks. But it was a hit or miss with the dishes in my party of 7. Only highlights were the chicken carbonara and a medium well traditional steak and potato dish. And am I the only one that finds the breadstick salty?!?!? Let me say our waitress Daphne made the experience pleasant and obliged our requests with a smile despite the less satisfying food. Would I go back....doubt it! I think after 4 times if you haven't impressed me why should I come back and spend money at your establishment. I've given them ample opportunities to get it right Go at your own risk.

"Okay Food. Okay Service. I was excited that Olive Garden opened up near to where I live in Queens. The decor was nice. My mom and I felt like we were eating in someone's home. Very nice. The salad was delicious. I could eat that salad all day! I ordered the tour of Italy which is a tasting of three dishes: lasagna with meat sauce (okay), fettuccine alfredo (okay), and chicken (okay). I ate a little bit of each dish. I wanted to be ""wowed' and I wasn't. I was hungry, so I ate it. A few weeks later I went back with my sister for lunch. It was crowded. The waitress took at least 10 minutes to come take our order. My sister was unable to get into the bathroom because a nurse was trying to take her male senior citizen patient into the women's bathroom. The nurse was told she could not take a man into the women's bathroom. Then the nurse said that her patient had already urinated on himself and there was no point in going to the bathroom. Needless to say, my sister and I lost our appetites. We left.

"NO STARS!! Last time I went to an Olive Garden was back in 1999.  I gave the restaurant in Roosevelt Field three opportunities but each time failed completely.  I decided not go back.  The managemetn, food, drinks and service were terrible! Yesterday, I was in Valley Stream with my husband.  He had never tried the chain and wanted to go. His excuse, ""the food in the commercials look really good.""  REALLY??!!   I though after several years this chain would have changed a little bit.  Unfortunately, it did not.  Same horrible service and food. When we arrived, we were told a 45 minute wait.  We decided to sit at the bar instead, there were seats all over the place, why the 45 minute wait??  Why do they always tell customers the same thing.  You see people waiting outside and when they seat you there are several empty tables. The bartender was ok, but the drinks had no flavor.  The food took approximately 40 minutes to arrive.  We ordered the pasta e fagioli was ok (2 stars).  The Grilled chicken (3 stars).  My husband who was anxious to get his seafood Brodetto (-5 stars) was very upset when only some shrimp and fish in the soup but no scallops! He told the bartender (Victor D) that the scallops were missing, the bartender went to kitchen and returned saying that he would get them shortly.  Shortly = 30 minutes later, the scallops arrived when my husband had already finished the soup.  Not acceptable. Because my husband was very upset, I decided to ask Victor for the check.  He told me yes but left the bar and went to serve others and kept ignoring us....SERIOUSLY!!! We wanted to get out of that place ASAP!!!  Finally I told him to give me the check (after 10-15 minutes).  My husband was fuming and told me Victor D. wasn't getting a tip.  We finally decided to leave $5 on a $73 bill. We are definitely not returning to any of the Olive Gardens.  They're being run poorly and the service need some training.",1.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Then afterwards we ordered our food, my friends got the 2 for 25 deal while i got the Chicken Marsala, btw we also got a free appetizer for doing a code that you can do by texting a number when you go in, so we ended up getting the calamari, which was really freakin good, the salad that he gave us before i love the italian dressing for it, it was nice salad. Anyways on to the meal part, MY FOOD WAS FREAKIN AWESOME i love the chicken marsala it was amazing, i highly reccomend it, one friend got shrimp alfredo and the other one got chicken alfredo, they both thought it was really good except one wanted their pasta more hot cause it was just warm, after that we got these desert it was like desert/cake shots i guess i forgot what they were called but it was good, the only thing that wasnt that great is that we didnt get refill of water and we got pretty thirsty but other then that the waiter kept checking up on us and gave excellent service, i guess that was our fault cause we had many time to ask for water lol but anyways its a cute Olive Garden, and it beats the one in the city thats on 21st street or 22 whatever.",5.0,"610 W Sunrise Hwy, Valley Stream, NY 11581",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"OGs new Med menu items are the bomb!  Attended an event with some fellow yelpers and this particular OG really out did every single OG I have ever been to.  My husband had got a thing fir their tried and true pasta bowl dishes.  I am always looking for something different and lighter. To me.a night out is not only about the food, its the whole experience.   Hands down this best of the best OG I've been to    Ian and his staff really try to make you feel like their long lost family reunited for a special meal.  Its fun, it's affordable, and it makes you want to keep coming back because you had such a memorable time out. Yes this is a chain restaurant which I gave 5 stars.  Is it the best italian food Ive had, no but was very good.  To me its the special combination of good food, great service. ambiance. and good company earn that 5th star. I like to wait a few days after I've been somewhere before I write my review.  It is those standout items that make me smile long after the experience I want to mention like their Spicy Calabrain Chicken started with a yummy cheese dipping sauce.  I had this with a glass of Green Apple Moscato Sangria, so good that one glass just isn't enough.  Also enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Piadina a lighter healther appetizer. I loved the wine pairings with each course.  It helps you explore how wine complements each dish without you guessing & OG does the home work for you.    For course two if you areva pesto fan this is a must, Cauatappi ans pasta had every one reaching for their forks.  Their Chicken Margharita with sliced grape tomatoes was so good.  Go with with a free friends and order family style.  We really liked the recommended Chardonnay with this course. Next up were some classic favorites Shrimp scampi and Chicken Piccata and they did not disappoint.   Seasoned just right and great with the recommended Pinot.     Next up was the linguine di Mare and a grilled chicken parm.   Our di Mare platter was generously filled with shrimp and mussels instesd of mostly pasta. Lastly my.favorite, the pumkin cheesecake.  You  just have to go for it.  Every blasted calorie is so good, it just can't be bad for you.   Pumpkin is a vegetable filled with beta c so this has to be good for you.

Linguine with pesto and grilled chicken. The pesto wasn't my favorite (too much on the olive oil) which I should have known it may be the case since no where else on the menu can you get a pesto dish besides the ""create your own"" section. One good thing is that our server was super nice. She was attentive and friendly. Breadsticks came out nice and hot. Salad is good but they overdo it on the dressing (which I'm guessing you can ask them to do it light or on the side). Not sure when this started, but once you finish, you can pay with the touch screen panels that are placed on each table (unless you're paying with cash). So, if your server is busy, don't worry, just check yourself out if there. I thought that was cool. When I was leaving there was a huge line! I'm super surprised as to how popular this place is since I know there are better Italian restaurants. But, for a family with kids, I can see why they come here.

I could easily drink a whole pitcher of this stuff and have no problem it is seriously delicious.

"I like Olive Garden for two reasons: their salad and breadsticks. This particular location isn't any different than the other Olive Gardens I've visited in terms of atmosphere and appearance. In general, I've always found their food to be very OK. It tastes good, but not amazing. The food is generally consistent, as I expect of a chain restaurant, and the service is good. Thanks to a consistent menu, their nutritional information is available online, and you can actually get a decently healthy meal. We started off with salad and breadsticks. Olive Garden salad is my favorite meatless salad for some reason. I would be happy to visit just to eat salad. Their breadsticks are also awesome, but unfortunately they were EXTREMELY salty on this particular visit. Also kinda hard, as if they were stale. For my entree, I got the Stuffed Chicken Marsala. Part of the chicken was a little rubbery, but overall, it was good. Anything stuffed with cheese is pretty good. The marsala sauce was good with the side of garlic mashed potatoes.

But 10 min ago, we checked with the same lady and she mentioned we are cleaning up the table for you now! OMG, what is going wrong with her? She got a short term memory?

As I type, she's on her phone not caring at all that I have an empty drink, or an empty bowl of soup asking if I want more. Seriously... get your staff together.

"I've been dining at this particular location for some time now. As a chain restaurant, the prices are average compared to their competition. The food is always decent and equally as good each time. Weekends are always busy being that they are near outlet malls. The fettuccine and chicken parm are the two dishes I occasionally order. I tried the tour of Italy but don't LOVE IT, it's okay. The lasagnes fritters is an appetizer and a must order. It's not too greasy but it hits the spot. Overall, not bad.",3.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"This is a very average Olive Garden. Nothing exceptional about it in either direction: Parking is limited in front of the store (don't bother with the pick up only spots; people always lie and just park) but there's a huge parking lot across the way. Front of house is a little slow, and you will wait a while for pickup orders or getting seated, but never too much longer than the estimated time that they give you when you first get there. Wait service is average; I've never had a bad server nor one that made me smile extra. Food is dictated by the chain and very on par.

"I'm writing this as a review of the Bergen Town Center Olive Garden.  I've been to this establishment a few times in the past and the service has never been so deplorable.  Just to be clear, this was not the waiter's fault.  From what i can tell, it was poor management. 1. We were seated by the bar area and were not approached by a server for about 30 minutes.  My husband had to go ask the hostess and then someone came. 2.  We ordered appetizers; mozzarella sticks and calamari.  How is it possible that this was brought to our table after we had received our main course and was cancelled.  Our waiter approached our table and said she spoke to the manager and the bill was corrected.  You bet it was.  We were not going to pay for something we didn't receive. 3.  I am not sure who is responsible for making sure that the tables had utensils and napkins available, but alas this was another issue.  When we received our meals, there was nothing to eat it with.  We told our waiter who went off stressed out looking for utensils and returned about 10 minutes later (food getting cold) with PLASTIC UTENSILS! Seriously? There were no real utensils in the restaurant and came out after.  All of the tables around us were using working utensils towards the end. 4.  After this entire fiasco we FINALLY receive the kids meals.  And not in its totality, the broccoli was brought out after our meals were almost done with.  It was barely touched since we had to give our kids what was available. 5.  The bill was not brought in a timely manner either.  And before it was, our waiter approached us and asked us cash or credit. At this point it should have been free! Apparently, it was a nice day out and everyone had called out, which happens.  However, not a single manager stopped by to apologize for this terrible service.  The waiter did her best with what she was working with, in my opinion and although we were annoyed and probably not a happy bunch, approached our table to apologize.",1.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Went here for lunch with my girl. We were seated within minutes. Soon we got our menus and decided to get a house salad and zucchini bites for the appetizer, and cheese ravioli and meatballs for the entree. The salad was as simple as it could be - lettuce with a couple other cheap ingredients like tomatoes and croutons, zucchini bites looked very tasty, but not as good in taste. The salad arrived together with bread, which was really weird. We devoured the salad while waiting for the other appetizer. Our rating for the salad would be 3.5 if it wasn't the house salad. Therefore it's 3 at most. House salad should be something more special than that or at least a better dressing, not italian dressing which tasted like lemon and salt with pepper. Zucchini bites 3.5 stars. The food was coming out at a regular pace - not fast, but not too slow either. By the time we finished that salad, those bites arrived. So we set aside empty plates and savored the sight of the zucchini bites. They were scattered on a long plate bouncing from a saucer filled with marinara. We tried them - it tasted like a potato. (Was that potato starch?). Neither of us expected that at all; It through me off for a second, but i tried another one to make sure that i didn't like it; we would've pushed the plate to the side as well, - a way to show that we're done - but the plates from the salad were still sitting on both corners already. At last after waiting, along with the plates, our entree arrived and we dug in. My girl liked ravioli. They were nice and cheesy, covered in sauce and more melted cheese on top. Meanwhile, i was dealing with the meatballs dish. The pasta tasted bland and meat balls were that type which you'd only buy in a store in the frozen isle section. I tried a peace and left the rest to take home, thinking if i won't have anything to eat and will feel lazy to cook something from scratch, that dish will be good enough to satisfy the hunger. Overall the meatballs dish is good enough for 2 stars at most and raviolis for 3. (My girl said they were good enough for frozen raviolis) Alright then 3 and a half stars it is. As for the service i liked how we were greeted by a hostess whose smile was welcoming us all the way to the table, and then the waiter introduced himself and created an attitude of being happy to see us. However, by the end of the service it wasn't as eager. That welcoming smile turned into a fake one; and waiting for the check or the to go boxes became a tough task. Finally, when he decided to check if we were ready to pay, he disappeared with the check.. ""I think he was in a restroom"" - my girlfriend said when he returned. (Maybe!) We were just glad the waiting for us was over. (Not for the plates though. All of them were still there). Service? 3 starts and i'm being generous here.",3.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

I had visited he olive garden in Paramus this past coming week. I must say it was one of the best experiences I had ever had visiting any Olive Garden location.

"First time I ever went to an Olive Garden and did not have a great experience. The food is far from authentic. We had to ask a different waiter for utensils. Our waiter never checked on us.  We were a group of 4. 3 of us received our food except my husband. The waiter came to check on us when we finished our meals so I told him that they forgot my husbands food. He asked us why we didn't let him know! How could we if he never checked on us? Anyway he brought my husbands food and it was nice of the manager to not charge us for the late dish. I also noticed that the people in the table next to us complained to the manager about the service. Some advice for the managers is to hire some adults and not all high school seniors because it looked like a play ground, there's nothing wrong with having fun but when it starts affecting the service towards the customers there's a problem. Will definitely not be returning to this location.",2.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"Olive Garden is my least favorite chain so maybe that's biasing my review but I will explain so here it goes. Olive Garden is not needed in this area because we have so many Italian people and authentic Italian restaurants around. It doesn't even come close to what you can get somewhere else. This chain is only needed in places where good Italian food is hard to come by (south and Midwest) definitely not here on the east coast. And I bet if we checked some statistics they would show that Olive Garden is thriving everywhere but the east coast (as a matter of fact, the one that just opened in Chicago has 4 stars). Their pros are their service, soups, salad and breadsticks. Their waiters and waitresses are super sweet, friendly and helpful. Their soups are pretty good but their salads are amazing. I love them. Definitely can't take that away from them. As far as all their regular food goes, I'm sorry to say this but it sucks. Especially compared to all the excellent Italian restaurants in this area. I don't know how they stay in business. Their risotto balls are good but the risottos balls at your local pizzeria just blow them out of the park. Their Alfredo sauce, marinara and bolognese are all ok but you go to another Italian restaurant and its infinitely better. So why even bother coming here? Really why bother? The unlimited soups and salads and their nice staff. That's it.",2.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I took my son for his 15th birthday along with the rest of the family to this corporate location. We got in about 15 minutes before dinner time because we wanted to give ourselves enough time to relax and not feel rushed. This place is probably the biggest disappointment I've had within the past two years of dining out. Me and my family work at a diner so we know what customer service should be like. When you go to the Olive Garden, you expect a cold salad with their signature Italian dressing, a lot of croutons, unlimited breadsticks, and sub par Italian corporate food, so I don't feel like my expectations should be exceptionally high. The server had a lack of concentration, because when we gave him our order he repeated four orders almost completely wrong. If your memory is not that great, I would recommend using a pad and writing orders down. Secondly, I had an ice tea spillage and it didn't seem anybody had noticed until about 10 minutes later when I got someone's attention. They told us to go over to the next booth and our salads arrived. Overall, they weren't as chilled as they should of been and could have had more dressing. There was absolutely no silverware on the table nor any other tables surrounding. Eventually, we were able to flag down a dishwasher to get us silverware after about 5-10 minutes of waiting for our server. The breadsticks didn't come until after the appetizers, and not one person came to our table to check on us or to ask if we needed anything. In fairness, it did become a little busy, but after we had asked our waiter for the check, he went and took another order at a neighboring table and we waited another 15 minutes until we decided to start walking to the front desk and then he had the audacity to ask if no one had bought us over our check. Like I said, I'm not expecting 5 star Italian food, but I am expecting someone that wants to make even a mediocre effort of just pretending that they want to be there. I will likely never go back to this location even if I had meals provided for free because it appeared chaotic and my son even spotted one worker dancing around in the kitchen. Next time I decide I want to go over to an Olive Garden, I will try Secaucus and if the service is lacking I probably will never return to an Olive Garden. What was actually funny about the whole situation was that I had told some family and friends that I was going to take my son to the Olive Garden because that was his selection, and they all had advised me otherwise. Perhaps others have had similar experiences before mine and had given it a low reputation. Sorry Olive Garden, it used to be good even if the food was more or less mediocre, however mediocre and very bad service just does not cut it.",1.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"O'live'd Olive Garden! Came here for a Sunday dinner and it was packed! The place is big and it was full! I think I know why. The food is delicious, reasonably priced and the service is excellent! I don't know why this place has such bad reviews. Maybe because they are a chain, people on here feel comfortable beating them up, so they can boost their number of 1 and 2-star reviews. If they are so bad, why are they packed? I came here for a Yelp Community Manager Event to try their new Fall menu about month ago. You can read that review here: yelp.com/biz/yelp-event-… We had such an awesome time at that event and we thought the food was delicious and the service was excellent, even over the top, so we wanted to come back as ""regular customers"" to see if we would get the same quality of food and service. My wife wanted the delicious pumpkin cheesecake for an appetizer and our well-mannered waiter, Mark S. totally understood. We also got the calamari and risotto bites. The calamari was cooked perfectly with the outside crispy and the inside tender but not chewy. The risotto bites were just as they were at the Yelp event, crunchy on the outside and creamy rice and cheese on the inside. We got the caprese salad upgrade which made the salad quite enjoyable. For entrees, I got the Grilled Chicken Butternut Squash Alfredo Fettuccine, which was awesome. You could taste the butternut squash everywhere and the chicken was juicy. My wife got the seafood alfredo and thought it was delicious. For desert, my wife got the chocolate almond amore drink, which was like a milkshake with some kahlua in it, and she thought it hit the spot. Our waiter, Mark S, was attentive and helpful the entire night. I didn't think we would get the same level of service as we did at the yelp event, but we sure did.

I love the breadsticks but they always seem to be a little on the cold side. Risotto balls are absolutely amazing, the polenta is tasty too. The lasagna bites need t be worked on, but for a small dish for $5.50 you basically will get a meal. After attending a Yelp event here and having the honor or tasting these dishes, I made mental notes of them and came back on my own to try them. All three are worth trying and are priced greatly.

If it wasn't free, I would have never normally came here anyway so maybe that makes my review bias, but if you're looking for good food that won't dehydrate you, don't come here. The pasta was completely overcooked and it had so much salt, you could barely taste any of the ingredients.  The stuffed mushrooms were actually still frozen in the center.  I'm not sure if they microwave their food, but it definitely tasted like it.

"A customer gave me a gift card to Olive Garden and this was our first visit. Our waiter Mohammad hustled us from the minute we sat down. We ordered glasses of wine and he kept suggesting the ""quartino"" (which I thought was a type of wine!) and wanted us to upsize or add on to almost everything we ordered. We had to ask several times for him to bring us the specials menu (3 course specials for $10.99) which we saw advertised. The clincher was when he told my husband that the regular coffee was ""bad"" and suggested he order a cappucino instead. I asked him several times to refill my son's water, which he never did. His service was poor and we got tired of hearing his personal stories. My husband agreed to ""upsize"" his included dessert for an additional $2 (which Mohammad suggested) and I ordered a chocolate mousse ""shooter size"" dessert for $2.79. Mohammad charged my husband the full dessert price of $6.49 and gave me the free shooter size dessert, even though I didn't have the 3 course special. Why? Because it increased the price of the bill to do it that way. We met family there, which was embarrasing, since this was our choice. By the time we left, we felt the place was a joke. The food was okay, but the constant pitch to add on and/or upsize is too much. No thanks. Never again.",2.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"I entered the parking lot by driving behind target and entering from the back of the lot so I didn't have to go on route 4. The interior is very pretty. The salad was basic and nicely dressed. The breadsticks are slightly soft and salty. The calamari was extremely tender -- loved it. The never ending pasta with shrimp and Alfredo sauce was delicious and a good value at $10 (came with soup). The tilapia and shrimp entree with broccoli was perfect and at only 300-something calories was a good choice. I would give the tilapia dish a 5 because it is satisfying and guilt-free. It's a small looking dish compared to big plates of pasta but it's satisfying nonetheless and an excellent option for health-conscious diners. The pumpkin cheesecake was a bit too sweet for my taste. I expect more tang. But it was yummy nonetheless. My son got the spaghetti kids meal, and he ate the entire thing, which is a rarity at restaurants. He ate a portion at the restaurant and the rest at home.

"First time trying an Olive Garden in over a decade. Went on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately. There were a number of employees standing around the hostess desk goofing around with their in-ear headsets and one employee was rapping into the mic while guests were waiting to be seated - very unprofessional. Waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly but that's when it went downhill. Fried calamari appetizer were the smallest rings ever seen and half the plate was soggy. The fried lasagna was tasty but dry. Waiter never returned with a second basket of bread as requested - it's supposed to be unlimited soup or salad and bread sticks. Entrees arrived for 4 out of the 5 guests. I asked the server if my plate was coming and she told me that they needed an extra 2 minutes. Our waiter did not return to our table for 20 minutes to ask if everything was okay and, needless to say, my entrée never arrived. It's customary for a waiter to pass by a table a few minutes after entrees are served to see if everything is okay, if beverage refills are needed, etc. After the waiter finally showed up and I told him that I never received my entrée, he offered to get it immediately but, since everybody was ready to leave, I told him to forget it and just remove it from the bill. Stuffed chicken marsala for one guest was just a soggy mess covered in bland sauce. The fettuccini alfredo for another guest was terrible and tasted like sauce out of a jar. Ultimately, the waiter packed the missing meal at no charge to-go and apologized but this level of oversight when the place is only half full is not acceptable. This place is absolutely terrible and you can get a much better meal with significantly better service anywhere else in the Paramus area.",1.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"As promised by the Management we were compensated for our last visit, as I received a $75 gift card with a card in the mail. So to keep our end of the bargain we returned and had a wonderful dinner. I started off with a wine sampling for 25 cents each of the Rosecasto, which was a fruity sparkling version of red wine which was great. But as usual I stuck with Moscato which was great also. For $9 I got one of those little carafes which was basically 1 3/4 glasses of wine. For food we started of with the Calabrian wings which were great. Last time they had a lot of spicy topping though this time they didn't but they were still great. Of course we had the usual salad and breadsticks which are always a house favorite. My bf got the Tour of Italy for $16.99 which included lasagna, fettuchinni alfredo, and chicken parmigane. He couldn't finish it and left the lasagna. He said it was very tasty. I had the stuffed chicken marsale for $16.99 with mashed potatoes. The chicken and sauce were good but I was not a fan of the stuffing in the middle, it wasn't horrible just wasn't a fan. I do however love their mashed potatoes. My daughter had the kids chicken fingers with pasta, side of mashed potatoes, and a drink for under $6. She liked the chicken and mashed potatoes. All in all the experience was much better the second time around. I feel like some of the dishes can be made better because they have the potential to fabulous dishes, but for the most part the food was excellent tonight.The service was great, the food was awesome and there was no wait to be seated (a huge plus at this location).

"This food chain is off the chain! Really impressed with the service here. Can't say any enough nice things about the staff. Even on a busy and overcrowded Sunday the service was impeccable. Now living in the East Coast makes it hard for any restaurant to sell Italian food because there's so many Italians here. You can't compare your mom's cooking to that of a restaurant, but in my humble opinion this is just straight up good food! I love their new menu ""Cucina Mia"". As always dessert first, you know I had the pumpkin cheesecake OMG it's too good I can eat that all day! Onto the appetizers, as a returning customer I NEED to get the calamari it is always crisp to perfection and never rubbery. 2nd must have for me is the crispy risotto bites with marinara sauce. These little balls are always a good time and I love to dunk the garlic bread in the sauce that's left over after I have my way with them. 3rd must have is the new caprese salad which includes kale, fresh fat mozzarella balls, bell peppers, basil, sun dried tomatoes, and olive oil. Yes we could tap out at this point, but we already ordered our dinner. Talk about yelper problems. So for dinner I had the seafood alfredo and that was so rich and creamy, with perfect amount of shrimp in every bite. I had to save half cause I was kind of full and a cute drink caught my eye. That drink was the chocolate almond amore, they said it had alcohol in it. I personally felt it was delicious as my second dessert, but not alcoholic enough for my like. It's ok I wanted a milk shake and that really hit the spot. Tasted like vanilla ice cream, almonds, and kahlua. As I sit here getting ready to go to the gym I ask myself would I do it again?

Pleaseee do not come here for another 6 months or so until the workers here get a damn clue. 45 min wait on a Monday night? Ok I'll deal & grab a drink at the bar. But what's up with the n00b bartenders though? Everyone sitting at the bar looked PISSED to say the least, our bartender got our drink order wrong, and tried to talk us out of getting the bar tab transferred to our table. Not hating on him trying to hustle but the entire process of paying took another 30 mins. Please stop wasting my damn time. Finally sat at our table & ordered our food. The sauvignon blanc came out LUKEWARM, and in the midst of pouring, the shitty server spilled a good portion of our wine all over my arm, phone, & lap. Say sorry all you want, but if you don't comp anything on our meal or offer more wine to compensate for your rookie mistake, you will not be receiving repeat customers. Oh and one last thing: I saw one of the managers ""overlooking"" the bartenders and he looked as clueless as the rest of them... Save your time & patience and opt for Bahama Breeze right next door.

"Going to a chain restaurant you would think the level of service and quality of food would be the same or at least close. It is totally not the case with this Olive Garden. Our usual Olive Garden in Horsehead NY is leaps and bounds ahead of this one. So our visit started with a 30 minute wait for the table. Which is understandable as its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. We were sat in the ASIAN corner of the restaurant. Which i thought was very odd. Walking out i saw that each race was relegated to their own portion of the restaurant. Very odd, maybe it was just the luck of the draw or there is some new system i dont understand. They came over and we were ready to order after a couple of questions about the new offerings. Normally we order the salad as we like unlimited salad w/ parmesan. They brought over the salad and didnt shave off the parmesan?!? we plow that and the breadsticks and asked for more. There was still no parmesan. Our appetizers came with our next round of salad and breadsticks. But to our surprise so did our main course and desert. now we were sitting at a booth the four of us. There is no room for 2 appetizer, 3 main courses 2 dessert, salad, breadsticks and drinks. In addition, they didnt do the parmesan on the entree's either!?!?! So mad. I spoke with the waitress about this and she didnt apologize or seem surprised. Rather it seem like the normal state of things. Food was normal, lacking fresh parmesan cheese.

I have got to say I am pretty disappointed with my experience yesterday. I normally go to this particular Olive Garden and never had any issues. I was there last night and ordered the fettuccini alfredo with sautéed shrimp. The pasta was dry and had a very little amount of alfredo sauce. Then instead of it being sautéed shrimp it was boiled baby shrimp which was terrible. To top it off they put literally a pound of dread crumbs on top. I have had this dish plenty of times and never had an issue. Thank god for the kind waiter who took the dish back but then I asked just for the fettuccini with alfredo sauce and no shrimp and I asked for it to be packed to go. When I got home a little later I opened the container to see dry pasta with what looked like 2 tablespoons of sauce. What a waste of money because that just went in the trash.

"So I read the reviews for this Olive Garden prior to going and I can't believe how accurate they were.  Like someone else mentioned the employees are absolute noobs. As soon as our party walked in, the hostess looks completely miserable.  She asks how many people our party are and then mumbles something while looking at me. I said ""I'm sorry"" and then realized she was talking on her radio/mic. She then said it would be a few minutes and didn't bother giving me a buzzer or even ask for my name. We sat in the waiting area and then saw 2 other parties of 4 or 6 come and be seated. They could've been there earlier with buzzers so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  But then the original hostess disappeared and another came over to ask if we are being helped. We again informed them we are a party of six then were immediately proceeded to our seats. For being open for 6+ months, get your sh*t together. As someone else mentioned, there IS an Asian area in here. I thought the previous poster was exaggerating or was just a coincidence, but it was segregated as mentioned. This didn't bother me that much but we asked if there was a table seating instead of a booth. The hostess said there isn't and there may be a wait. So after some awkward silence we were then seated near the bar which was half empty with 2 tables with available seating of six.  I don't understand why it was such a hassle. Our main waitress provided much better service than the front hostesses. Food was ok for the price, but was of Applebee's type of quality, but it is a chain so it makes sense.  Only can give 2 stars because nothing gets me more irritated than bad service when the restaurant isn't even busy.",2.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
"Oh my, I just don't know what happened with this place. We rarely come out to Olive Garden, but I was craving the breadsticks for some odd reason. We have been to this location 2 times, but surprised how bad the service has gone down hill, especially since it's in ""Bergen county"". We waited about 15min and I gave the look to my husband that we should just leave..within a minute or two, I guess the manager read my mind and he came over and apologized that no one took our order. Then he took our order and we waited a bit for the soup and bread but figured if we can wait 15 min to be noticed, waiting another 15min for soup & bread wasn't going to be too bad. Soup and bread was good, but our appetizer never arrived. Finally our dinner arrived and I mentioned to the waiter to just cancel the appetizer....husband's meal wasn't great, he said the chicken tasted like a cold toasted chicken patty. My stuffed chicken marsala was okay, surprisingly needed a little salt. We wanted to order dessert but didn't want to wait another 15-20min to get that.

Did she forget that as a waitress she may ask questions?? Rather than taking random guesses. To top it off, at the beginning of our dinner the waitress did not ask whether we wanted soup or salad. My family pointed it out to her, she stated if we wanted soup she would give it to us. Later, when we asked for soup, she stated we can only have one or the other.

"Went tonight for dinner. Olive Garden has held a special place in my heart as it was my first date with my now fiance. After waiting for about 45 minutes for a table for a party of six we were finally seated at a corner table behind the bar. Now once seated we were never greeted by any wait staff. For 15 minutes we sat thirsty and not a waitress in sight. Even the couple next to us said they were waiting such a long time. So after 15 minutes I went to the front of the house to speak to the hostess and asked for the manager. While waiting for the manager I asked a girl by the kitchen door where all the waitress' were and she just ignored me. The manager, a younger man who was very polite, apologized and immediately sent a waitress to our table. She asked if anyone else had been by the table and we answered no. That's when I found out that these waitresses are not assigned tables. So it's no surprise that the wait staff was so unorganized. She took our drink order and the manager came over and apologized again and offered to comp us a appetizer. The appetizer I chose was the new bruschetta caprese which was less then impressive. The bread was burnt and the bruschetta was watery and not flavorful at all. For my entree I had the steak gargonzola. It was exceptional, but out of my group I was the only to enjoy my entree. My fiancé had a chicken dish that she could not eat since it was overpowered with peppers but she did not want to put up a fuss since our experience was less then par at this point.  The other issue I had which is kind of a pet peeve is the table was not cleaned properly and was sticky in some places and oily in others. And finally the overall service. I felt that we were basically rushed out since 5 minutes after receiving our salads and apps our entrees were brought out. We barely had time to eat our apps. In closing I hope management can get this place together. I have been such a fan of Olive Garden for years and now I must say this experience may have cost them my business.",1.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

"WORST OLIVE GARDEN EVER. The manager (his name tag said Michael) is HORRIBLE and obviously does not know WHAT he is doing. Plus, the food is...ehh... We get to the restaurant and ask how long for a table for four. They say 20 minutes so we give them my name and wait holding a buzzer. 40+ minutes and nada, so I go to ask, and they ask me what the number on the buzzer is. I tell the lady and she asks me with a confused look on her face, ""party of 8?"" I tell her no. She says, ""seven?"" Finally she asks me my name and gives me the chance to say party of four. We are not on the list, and they blame it on the buzzer and say that they must've called for us. The buzzer never rang. We were maybe 3 feet away from the hosts and they never even tried to call us by name. And while I am with them dealing with this problem, not once do they apologize...for the wait, for not being on the list...nothing. Some person of authority directs a host to take us inside, but he leaves us standing right in the middle of the restaurant where waiters need to pass by while we watch as two or three parties are seated. We get dirty looks from the waiters, I guess for being in their way until we're finally taken to a table. I wanted to leave, but my boyfriend insisted that we should not waste the time that we had waited so we stayed, and I expressed my concerns to the waiter, who was very nice. He notified a manager for us, and that's when Michael came and made it worse. He says something like, ""the waiter notified me of some concerns?"" and he obvious does not want to be there and has no desire to listen. I tell him about what happened, and he cuts me off mid-sentence several times with comments that make me feel like I misheard and misunderstoofpd the entire situation. He tells me the hostess should not have told me that it was a 20 minute wait because the wait has been over an hour sine before we came in. He doesn't apologize for anything, he just says that he will tell them that they should inform everybody that the wait is at least an hour. And he basically just leaves. He doesn't solve any problem. If I were him, I at least would have voided the three sodas that we ordered. He said he'd make sure our food came ASAP, but by then, it was already past the amount of time we should be waiting for food. Just a top really bad experience overall.

"Went for lunch with my wife the first week they opened, and understood it could be a rough opening, and it was - much rougher than expected.  For an established brand such as Olive Garden to open, you would expect they would have their ""A"" team taking the lead to provide a great first impression.  No so.  The service was extremely slow and lacking in the fundamentals, such as providing menus, utensils, water - took about 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes before taking our order.  Thought we would play it safe and order soup and salad.  Now I know why they advertise the ""bottomless"" and ""unlimited"" portions.  They are just about inedible.  The approx. 8 oz. of soup was lukewarm and loaded with salt.  The salad was drenched in dressing and oversalted, and the bread sticks were greasy and salty.  Their site advises that the soup contains 1,080 mg. of salt, for one serving!  There should be a warning that more than one serving is hazardous to your health.  Although the over use of salt, fat and sugar in their servings taste will make almost anything taste ok, they are all very addictive and one of the major reasons for health problems and obesity. Another couple with us ordered chicken, and vegtables.  It was drenched in olive oil and with a sauce not even remotely italian.  Overall, this is nothing more than a typical corporate rip-off of a very popular, and healthy food, when done right, that is advertised to give the illusion it is authentic.  If you are Italian, this place is a total insult, especially since they can't even get soup, salad and breadsticks right.  Do yourself, and your taste buds a favor, and instead go to your local Italian pizza/restaurant that is sure to be better, and much healthier.  There are also much better non-italian choices in the immediate area.",1.0,"1620 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Absolutely love the menu at longhorn;however the service here is awful. Asked the hostess for a big booth as we were six people. Plenty open but she stuck ya at the one right in front of the bathroom instead of cleaning one in the main area.  Our server just wasn't built for this position.

Usually don't like to dine in chains but every once in a while I get sucked in. Came here a few times and food has been pretty legit and the service is overall good as well. One complaint I had was there selection in craft beer; it is seriously lacking. Last time I was there I tried the 6oz sirloin steak and shrimp selection and both were cooked good and to order. Came with two sides and a salad. Another positive about this place is I never had to wait to get seated or greeted.

"Worst experience EVER tonight at LongHorn Steakhouse (Bayonne, NJ). A few weeks ago I went in & had dinner & purchased two gift cards. I was given the activation confirmation receipts for each of the cards, paid the total bill in cash plus tip & left. Went to use one of the gift cards tonight & was told by the waitress with a massive attitude ""oh I remember you. You short paid the bill so we DEACTIVATED your gift card after you left"". She called for a manager who was equally as rude, condescending, & acted like I was the problem. I told her that it was much more likely that the issue was with the waitress than with the customer, but in any case they can't deactivate a gift card after the customer has left the restaurant with the card plus activation receipt. Imagine if I had given the card to someone as a gift for the holidays?!? I find it incredible that the waitress claims to remember me from 3 weeks ago & remembers that we didn't pay the right amount at that time. Of course we paid in cash so it's convenient that she now remembers this when there is no way to prove it anymore. The truth is she probably miscalculated the bill or ""someone"" walked off with the cash. Way to go LongHorn Steakhouse making a customer feel like a criminal!!

Cons: Our waitress was unpleasant, to the point of having a slight attitude. Nothing horrible, but it seemed like she doesn't like people. I'm not sure if she miscalculated when entering our order, but it took so long to get any food that half our party had to box up the food and leave since there was nothing to keep the baby calm, despite the books, toys, and puffs we brought to occupy her while waiting for food. Also, she replaced my rice with a sweet potato when the sweet potato was supposed to be a side for me to feed my daughter. Another con was that the smoothies can't be made in adult sizes. We had large smoothies all the time at the Parsippany Longhorn. They charge more and make more. I'm not sure why this is a problem.

For those who would prefer more details, I ordered a ribeye steak here which was tough and not cooked according to my specifications (medium rare). My friend ordered a grilled chicken salad  entree with dressing on the side, but received it both on the side as well as in the salad. Unfortunately, they overloaded it with the dressing, which was the exact problem she was trying to prevent. Service is dismal. My friend's dad asked for steak sauce, but he was halfway finished with his steak by the time the waitress came over with it. Speaking of the waitress, we could not find her or any of the other members of the wait staff at all about 75% of the time, including when it was time for the check. In addition, our waitress never checked on us once during the entire meal. She had a noticeable blase' towards our party for some reason. Now, for these chain places, I would be willing to forgive these issues if it occurred over the weekend or a Friday night. But this outing was on a Monday night where the restaurant was not even half full. If you must come here, enjoy the bread/salad and try the pork chops.

The good: steaks are very good and are truly cooked to order. If I order it rare, I get it rare. If my husband orders it well-done, it's served well-done. The parmesan crust is a nice extra, but if you don't need the excess carlories, avoid it. Other dishes are quite good. The trout was especially tasty. I've found that the wait staff are all very personable. I've had wonderful service every time I've been there, and I am impressed that such a new place offers such good service. The not so good: this place is loud! The ceilings are high and don't offer any baffling of sound. I've seen large families allow their kids to run around. Two young Russian women (yes, they were speaking Russian) weren't watching their kids, and the little ones ran off with a carpet sweeper.

Add insult to injury the steak was so over cooked and charred on the outside while the middle is still raw when we ordered medium. We ended up throwing most of it away and just wanted to get out.

"Went here to grab a few beers and have dinner with a buddy of mine. Came on a Tuesday night and the place was literally empty. It was definitely a turn off. We ordered the shrimp and lobster dip. Pretty bad. It had no flavor and a burnt taste. Then I ordered a New York Strip. It wasn't terrible but was pretty much on par with an Applebee's steak. Which is absurd considering this place fancies itself a steakhouse. From what I hear, this place is pretty consistently empty. I can pretty much guarantee that I will kit be returning. For only a increase in price, you can have a pretty legit steak somewhere else.",2.0,"907 Bayonne Crossing Way, Bayonne, NJ 07002",LongHorn Steakhouse
Appetizer sampler.. 3 pieces per item but was good. Not crazy about the stuffed mushrooms. Caesar salad was delish.. i know its just a simple salad but it had shavings of Parmesan and it was really good. My friend got the strawberry salad and that was pretty delicious too. Ordered the sirloin with shrimp and fries. Very good cut... very lean.. well done. best steak I've had yet honestly... Fries were seasoned well.. and not too salty. Rice was good.Dessert sampler was okay. I really liked the cheesecake and I'm not that into cheesecake. It was rich and flavorful.

"i almost never write a bad review because I have worked as both a bartender and a waiter, and i understand that there are off nights and what not.  but this is different. simple version:  it amazes me that this place manages to stay in business.  have been to this longhorn twice and the service is awful, the food is bland, and the portion vs. price is absurd.  Both times I went I ordered the ny strip, and both times it was a super thin piece of meat.  i ordered it medium rare, it arrived well done.  both times.  that's because it is thin and it probably sat there dying in the food window waiting to be delivered (the same would have happened to our mixed drinks, but the bartender came out from behind the bar to serve them to us).  the waitresses were nowhere to be found pretty much anytime, which is problematic when your gf has her meal but no silverware.  or when your drink order was clearly not put in, and you got your salad before ever getting a drink.  like i said, 1 bad experience can just be coincidence.  but twice my experience with both the food and staff was awful. If Outback opened anywhere remotely close to here, this place would go under.  Not that Outback is some amazing place, but it certainly buries this place in the chain restaurant steakhouse category.

My boyfriend and I were seated but the waitress took forever to come and welcome us! We went on a Monday night which wasn't busy at all and I didn't understand why it took her such a long time to bring drinks, food, and even the check. The food was okay, my boyfriends steak was not cooked to his choice medium rare, at least they took the steak back and made it right. The appetizers were okay, we tried the western shrimp. I felt like I was eating more of the bread than actual shrimp. Just as I thought visiting this place was over, I checked my bank statement a couple days later and the waitress decided to tip herself, after I had placed a ZERO for tip and wrote the balance.  This is horrible, please check your statements after visiting this place! This Bayonne location is filled with young adults, which I do believe in giving young individuals the chance to gain experience somewhere but they act like they don't care.

This was the case for many tables, as the kitchen was backed up. We were one of many tables who complained to the manager, who was very kind and apologized by only charging us for one meal, drinks, and giving us free dessert. That was very respectable and I felt bad for him, because the company clearly didn't want to hire enough people in the restaurant to keep up with busy crowds and the responsibility falls on him.

"My parents wanted to have a family dinner since we don't get together for meals that often, and they decided that they wanted to try the new Longhorn Steakhouse. The inside looks nice ... it's spacious (my dad remarked that this was probably the biggest restaurant in Bayonne, aside from maybe Houlihan's and the Chandelier) and it's got interesting Western-themed decorations. The lighting is good and it wasn't loud, and the crowd didn't seem trashy or anything (the Houlihan's in Bayonne can sometimes get like this, which is a shame because Houlihan's is pretty great as far as chain restaurants go). Our party was seated right away. I don't remember the waiter's name, but he was *incredibly* attentive throughout the night. Our drink orders came out quickly, he took detailed food orders and he quickly replenished our bread basket (soft, tasty honey wheat bread). Everyone got a salad as part of their meal, and for some reason the salads were slow on getting to our table but our waiter kept checking in on us every few minutes and assuring us that the salads would be out soon. When the salads came out, he said that the food was nearly ready but he'd hold it back for us if we wished ... we said it wasn't necessary and thanked him. He refilled the drinks as we needed them. I wish I remembered his name because he was excellent and very nice. The menu had a lot of options for appetizers, entrees and side items. One person ordered a ""Texas Tonion,"" which is a large plate of deep-fried onion pieces and sauce. Pretty much a deconstructed Outback Bloomin Onion. It tasted good and we all shared it. I ordered a sirloin, and that included a side (mashed potatoes) and salad (Cesar). The salad was good, fresh lettuce and tasty dressing. The mashed potatoes were O.K. My husband had the pork chops and he was impressed, my dad had a lobster tail and liked it, my vegetarian sister pieced a meal together out of some side items, and those who got steaks enjoyed them. My steak ... it didn't taste bad, it was tender and it was cooked to order. But it was your average chain restaurant steak. Maybe I'm spoiled because I just had a fabulous steak at an upscale steakhouse last weekend, but I wasn't impressed. I knew going into the meal that it wouldn't be fabulous, as I've eaten at the Piscataway location before and I didn't love it ... but you know what, it's a chain restaurant and those are rarely fabulous. We had a pleasant conversation in a nice atmosphere, and we were very well taken care of by our great waiter, so it wasn't a bad evening by any means. If you're really craving a good steak but you don't want to spend a ton of money, go to Arthur's in Hoboken. If you want a really nice steak meal and you have some money to spend, go to Edward's in Jersey City. If you're looking for a decent meal in a nice setting and you're staying in the Bayonne area, Longhorn would be fine. I don't think I'd go back on my own (I'm admittedly getting to be kind of a restaurant snob when it comes to chains), but if my family wants to go again I won't refuse.

"I went there twice. The second time was to determine if it was as really as bad as I experienced the first time.  The first time.  The waitress was slow and not really interested.  As others said, the bread was good but not enough.  She took our empty bread serving basket and never returned with more bread.  Food was pretty good.  Nothing special.  We waited over 25 minutes for our food at 1:30 pm.  Much too long and the place was almost empty.  Bill came and I used my Darden Restaurant card.  Card did not have enough on it but waitress never told us what the problem was.  Just left it on the table without comment.  Manager walked by and I asked him.  He explained like the waitress was supposed to.  I gave them another card. Waitress came back with card, and receipt.  Said I had to sign for it.  She did not have a pen.  Came back again without pen. We walked out. Still gave her a nice tip. Second time. Service was great. Got my 12 oz ribeye in 12 minutes. Still only small portion of bread. Took empty basket and no refill. At ordering of the 12 ounce ribeye I asked waitress if  it came with anything.  She said it came with one side and suggested vegetable and rice. I took her word for it.  Again she took the bread basket and no refill.  Only a small portion of bread. They give the same amount of bread whether it is for one or two persons.  The steak appeared to me to be small for a 12 ounce.  The vegetable was broccoli and was perfect.  The rice was ok.  Steak great and had little fat when served.  About 1% of the steak served was fat.  My real disappointment was being charged for the rice and broccoli  after being told it came with the steak at no charge. Next time I will use my camera and photograph my order.  Also maybe take a scale and weigh the served steak. I think I got about 8 ounces rather than nearly 12.  98% of the restaurants I go too are so stingy with things such as bread in this case. And wait staff is not trained.  Our second waitress was courteous enough but neither was fully trained.  Also instead of just writing on here go to that restaurant web site.

"My first time here was great, that's why I keeps coming back, however, it seems each experience I come is getting worst and worst, now is to the point that I don't want anymore. Take so long to come take my order while is not busy there 4pm, forget my bread, never came to check on the table, my glass of tea is empty in the half way on my dinner till the end, all they do is bring food to the table that's it. The worst part is the food, the reason I still come here even is slow and no service because of the steak is good, but the steak today is so dry that I can't even chew. Very disappointed.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Was craving Cheesecake factory bread but refused to go to the QCM location because of the bad reviews. Ended up at Longhorn but really wish I hadn't. The wait wasn't too terrible on a Saturday night (25-30min). It was extremely difficult to find parking because the lot was full. Our server was very polite and attentive. The dining experience overall was not bad. This review earns its 1 star because of the horrible food. The free honey wheat bread was okay but only served in quarter sizes? I had to ask my server for more bread about 10x. The appetizers were very average, if I was starving to death I'd probably eat it. The steak was extremely disappointing. I know this isn't a 5 star steak house, but for Longhorn, I expect the steak to at least be edible. I ordered Flo's Filet expecting it to be tender. It was so tough and chewy that I could not even swallow it. The server was very accomodating and switched it for a sirloin, but even the sirloin was inedible! They cover their meats with tons of marinate, which takes away the flavor of the meat itself. I don't know how they cook their steak but they got to change something about it. I then ordered the molten lava cake to make myself happy. Pro tip: a chocolate cake with pudding in the middle does not make it a lava cake. Save the trip here, go to Mama's instead.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

I hardly ever do the whole chain restaurant thing. Long story short for the price the meal was great. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoe. The steak was perfect medium.

"Not the first time I ate here and this time it was a disappointment. The hamburger I wanted to be medium was very dry and a little burnt from the outside. The French fries  that came with the hamburger are very very small and very fatty/oily. We ate mushrooms and cheese, which was also very oily and not very good. I will note that the bread you get is very tasty, there is a free reefill for soft drinks and the service was very nice and courteous. When we said that there was a problem, they immediately offered to replace the dish. They called the manager who also offered  us a dessert for free. We did not change or take it, but they took it seriously.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"I'm not big on chain restaurants but my friend is so we went for lunch today. Only 3 tables had people,other than that the restaurant was empty. We literally waited for about 15 to 20 for someone to take our drink orders and bring out bread. When the waiter did come by he was polite but we waited another 15min for our drinks and bread. I was already annoyed but don't want to be rude to people that handle your food lol. I got the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked medium rare how I like it and the potatoes were buttery and delicious. But due to that very long wait to be taken care of ruined it for me.

"This is a chain so basically you will get what you get any you can't expect amazing amazing food. Service was really friendly, our server was really quick with everyone which was nice cause you don't always get that in chains. I won't lie my favorite was the bread and butter cause nothing beats hot bread and butter. We got Texas Tonion don't recommend it at all, i just wasn't a fan we had a couple of pieces but it basically looked like we barely touched the place. The sweet corner fritters were good that we finished. We also had a burger and a steak melt, wasn't a big fan of the melt it just wasn't as tender as I would have liked. We also got a side of lobster and it just felt like there was no seasoning on it.

"This is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to!!! I do realize that this is not a Michelin starred restaurant, but dear me, I also think that you can expect some sort of standard when you go out to eat. Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor. Where do I start? We had to wait for 20 minutes to be greeted. When finally a nice gentleman came over and said to us he's not even in charge of our table. ( the restaurant was not even busy)!!!! Finally the food came,please take a good look at the picture!! Our appetizer is the greatest Longhorn nacho!!!!- Absolutely disgusting. Oh lord have mercy! My 5 year old could've made better nacho than this!!! I guess this franchise makes nacho with no cheese and left over burnt brisket! KFC would have been better choice than Longhorn! I will never come here again! Completely ruined my Sunday night!

"I love steak and have had steak in many restaurants varying in price points so my expectations were pretty low when it comes to chain steakhouses. Skipped the apps, two entrees, first was the flat iron steak, tasty, seasoning had a slight kick and cooked perfectly (rare). Second was a 20oz prime rib, that's where things go terribly wrong, two words, STAY away. This was the worst piece of meat I've ever ordered, anywhere (see my pic)! Prime rib is supposed to, and they claim, cooked slow for hours to maximize flavor &  tenderness, not the case here, the steak appeared to have been cooked 'À la Minute'. I wanted to like this place,  yt cannot recommend. If you want good pirce of prime rib at a chain restaurant, head to Miller's Ale house (Tues/Thus only as of this review) where it's done right.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"So I decided to give LongHorn Steakhouse another try after being disappointed the first time I came here. Typically one's experience at this location begins by driving around the block a few times and getting frustrated by not being able to find parking. On the bright side, this restaurant's reputation has gotten worse, so the wait to sit at a table isn't as long as it used to be. As a matter of fact, we were seated immediately after arriving at the restaurant. We started with the Sweet Corn Fritters, which I'll admit, was pretty good. The sauce and the corn fritters went together well. For entrée, I ordered the LongHorn Porterhouse steak. I would say it was decent. The inside was cooked as I wanted but the outside had an overpowering charcoal taste. My side of mashed potato wasn't that good and the creamed spinach was just so-so. For dessert, we shared a Key Lime Pie, which I wish had a stronger key lime taste. The one positive about dining here was that our waitress, Aisha, was super nice. Her service was top-notch. You could tell she was a little new, but she knew the menu, and she tried very hard to be a great waitress. Will I be back at LongHorn? No way! I think I gave this restaurant more than enough chances.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
I love Longhorn steakhouse! Our experience here was great! Currently I am doing a low carb diet and it is hard to find restaurants with healthy options. Today we went and the food was amazing. We both got the Flo steaks with a side of broccoli. The meat was cooked perfectly and very tender. Seasoning was delicious! Got the loaded baked potato to share as a splurge. The hostess was super friendly and we were checked on by multiple waiters throughout the meal. Will definitely be back!

"I'm not sure how they have been here but this is my first time at this location. I've been to Longhorn's before though. It's located kind of behind the Queens Mall so it gets busy in that area depending on when you go. They have their own lot which is nice. The restaurant itself is pretty much standard Longhorn Decor.

First off, the restaurant is really big and has such a beautiful cabin like resort feel to it. Staff here seem friendly and attentive. Our server was really cool and attentive. Everyone with me ordered different types of steak and they said it was delicious and done right. I had the parmesan crusted chicken with a loaded baked potato and it was life changing. Im so silly but my chicken was beyond delicious. Actually my whole meal was great except for my margarita. All I tasted was salt. We all enjoyed our time and meal here. I would definitely come back.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
Get the strawberry margarita. Love the idea of using rock candy as a stir stick. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but it was not at all. The calamari could have had a better sauce. I rather have seen tempura vegetables mixed in with it for color and texture. The prime rib was huge but would have liked it to have more flavor. I would have preferred rosemary and garlic added to the prime rib. If you love blue cheese then order the blue cheese romaine salad but order the dressing on the side otherwise the salad will need a life preserver. I would have gave this restaurant 3 stars but the margarita pushed it to 4 stars. I am getting thirsty just thinking about it.,4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"I've been to other locations for Long Horns and have generally been impressed - for a chain, they are fairly good. Came here for dinner on a weeknight. They just didn't have enough people working I think. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table, while there were tons of tables open (again assuming not enough waitstaff). Once we were seated we did get water.... everything else took forever, just to flag our waiter took forever. I had a Moscow mule - it came in a glass, and was more water and ice than anything else. Between our group we had a burger, a steak and the ribs. The meat was decent, very edible. The sauce on the ribs was great - finger licking good. The fries were good, except that the there was a huge puddle of oil at the bottom. The mashed potatoes didn't taste like they were made fresh, I do not expect to spend 1.5 hour and a half to eat a quick dinner. So not worth the quality of the food.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

Finally waiter (nick) walks out of the kitchen and  he gets another waiter (Jay) to help.  This was a bad experience, not sure where the ball dropped on staff.

This location is fairly large with a big parking lot too. All of the food we had was excellent. For the starter, we had the Firecracker Chicken Wraps. They were not very spicy but still tasty nonetheless. Then, for the entrees, we had the Baby Back Ribs, Sirloin Steak (the biggest size, 11 oz.), and  a Steakhouse Burger. All of them were great. The meat was juicy and not dry at all. Nice flavor too. We gladly finished everything with ease. Prices are not bad either. Almost all the entrees are in the $10 to $20 range.

"Being a huge fan of Outback, this is an interesting comparison for me as they are extremely similar. The place has a free parking lot (shared with Olive Garden, so parking may not be easy at times) and is located right next to the mall and the Woodhaven Blvd. subway station. The interior has the same kind of dim-lighting as Outback and makes me feel as if I was in Texas. They have really cute mugs (mini barrels) for some of their alcoholic beverages (most of them are limey flavored) annnnddd our waiter was super nice! First you get bread with butter. Bread appears to be whole wheat, pre-cut, and warm. The butter was not very melted, so it was hard to spread. Outback wins. For my appetizer, I ordered the mushrooms. It was DELICIOUS. SO GOOD. Okay, so my vocabulary sucks-- but you get what I mean. There's a coupon for a free appetizer you could get from their website if you sign up. I ordered the 18oz steak, medium rare. WOW. That steak was raw lookin', but it wasn't bloody and tasted DELICIOUS. I did not know it was possible for a steak to look raw but not actually taste raw. Longhorn wins. I ordered the steak with the sweet potato and the caesar salad. The sweet potato was as expected, baked and filled with sugar-- same as Outback. The caesar salad was dreadful and generic. It was as if leaves and croutons were thrown together (and barely any dressing)-- I prefer Outback's wedge cut salad. It was okay.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Got takeout from the bar. Sunday late afternoon, not crowded at all, yet the manager and staff at the bar seemed very frazzled and hectic, running around, in and out. Seemed as if they were understaffed? We told a girl we were picking up food. We saw her go pack up the food in the back. She was nice, and worked efficiently. We weren't waiting more than 5 minutes. But there were items definitely forgotten: Cesar salads without any dressing. Salads definitely need some kind of dressing! The romaine looked good though, green, mostly crisp, and no brown spots. Definitely a plus. No utensils, ketchup, mayo -- which were all requested from our online order. Also, the front area/host section and the bar smelled very musty, like dirty mop water that hadn't dried, or they were using dirty water to clean over and over. It was extremely off putting. This was just for a takeout order -- I could not see myself sitting there and eating while smelling that. No thanks. Other menu items: Cinnamon bourbon bites: A nice crispy bite, but was overall a bland piece of fried dough. The cinnamon bourbon glaze was sparse, so there wasn't a lot of it to go around. If there had been more, it would have been tastier. Didn't get the cinnamon flavor, but tasted the hint of alcohol. Chocolate molten cake: A huge disappointment -- it was a big piece of cake, but the cake wasn't light and fluffy like I anticipated. And the inside didn't seem molten like, but more... fudge like and thick. When i think of a molten cake, I imagine a bundt shaped thing, soft moist chocolate cake with a burst of liquid chocolate in the center. Filet mignon  and mashed potatoes -- was hearty, and cooked medium rare. But coated excessively in pepper. If it hadn't been there, it would have been a good steak, albeit a bit salty. There is an online option to go for the unseasoned steak I think. Burger -- A big burger patty. Was cooked medium rare as requested, and was good. but for me, just too big of a burger. It would be nice to have a better meat to bun ration. This is a personal preference though, as my husband loved the burger. Easy online ordering, and the site will take coupons.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

The service throughout the night was a little slow I would say. I like that all the steaks (and other entrees) come with a salad and another side. I got the loaded baked potato which was absolutely delicious. The waiter went over the different types of steaks and I chose the flat iron steak because it had only a small amount of fat. I liked it! It was cooked medium just as I asked for it and the peppery seasoning gave it a nice flavor. However, my boyfriend and my steaks got switched from the beginning, so as soon as I saw my baked potato on the plate, I took it and started eating his prime rib. This was SO delicious.

Now for food we ordered the steak sliders, chili cheese fries, sweet Thai chili chicken and corn fritters. I have to say the sliders, fries and chicken were really good, the fritters were okay I wouldn't get them again.

"For my office holiday party Longhorn Steakhouse was chosen as the venue. Located right next to the very busy Queens Center Mall, I've eaten at other Longhorn Steakhouses before, so I was expecting a similarly solid experience. For our group of thirteen we started with three orders of the Wild West Shrimp shareable appetizers and it was solid starter. Nice to taste that the shrimps were neither overly breaded nor over cooked, and they were still fresh tasting. I particularly liked the cherry peppers the shrimps were resting on as they really imparted a nice tartness that cut the richness of fried shrimp and the ranch dipping sauce. I ordered the 11oz. ""Renegade"" sirloin steak and it was not bad at all. Of course I ordered it medium rare (especially since sirloin's are a lean cut) and despite being slightly overcooked (somewhere between medium rare and medium), the steak was still tender and moist. Seasoning was aggressive, which I generally prefer, but I think the seasoning was a bit too salty. For my side I chose the baked sweet potato with cinnamon, sugar, and butter. I've always been a fan of sweet potatoes and this version was cooked perfectly. I loved that it was baked to the point where the potato skin was crispy and almost like a thin chip.  Add in a copious amounts of cinnamon and sugar, and I was very happy with my side! Service was just okay. We had thirteen people in my group and only one waitress providing service. She did her best, as I noticed she also was servicing three other tables, but the food came out a bit slow and bread came out only when I reminded her as the entrees were being served. The others in my group all mentioned the food was solid as well, and nobody noted any major issues. Of note: Though I did not partake in any dessert, several others did and the portions were really really large. Overall a solid lunch, nothing unexpected, and nothing exceptional.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
So i call this place to set up a birthday dinner this is the sister store to my fav spot capital grille which I frequent for my birthday. Well surprisingly they dont take reservations mind you im calling ahead because i have a party of 5. I was told no we dont take reservations i said ok wow even for big parties not even on the day of? I was like ok cool this place was like sitting on my mind my sister worked her for 2 months shes in college and when she left i never asked why ? So i call her to complain she said yeah theyre ghetto asf thats why she left. She couldnt live with her self knowing the stuff they do to your food and how they treat the customers behind their backs. If your a complaining customer the manager will tell the chefs aka children of the corn to spit and do what ever to your food  or better yet tow your car.

The first time we came here was a bad experience. The ribeye we ordered was pathetic and almost as thin as a coldcut slice. On top of that It was oversalted to a point almost not edible. After leaving disappointed I called the place and complained. We gave this place another try yesterday and it was a complete 180. We avoided the ribeye and instead got the new York strip steak and prime rib. They were an inch thick and cooked medium rare just as we  wanted.

I had a great experience here today! The food & the service was absolutely amazing. Me & my boyfriend started off with the calamari which was a burst of delicious flavor in your mouth.

Yes we did order that ribeye medium and we got a haha of an extreme RAW. We did maintain our manners, but enough is enough.

So they did manage to bring it back and no, the manager was not presenting the wonderful same piece of meat they butchered up, that's their thorough cooking job.

"Went here on a Saturday night. The place seemed pretty busy, but the bar was relatively empty. Upon entering, the hostess was a bit cold to me and basically just told me to go to the bar if I didn't want to wait. Though, I totally understand what it is like when your establishment is under heavy fire and the last thing you want to see is someone walk through the door. Used to be a busboy back in the day and even that is soul-sapping at times. So, to the bar I went. The service was pretty good considering how frantic everyone seemed. The guy at the bar took good care of me and was efficient for sure. I ordered the Flo's Filet 6 oz steak combo with lobster tail for $30. Got a tall draft of Sam Adam's seasonal, a side of mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob. My total was just over $40 aside from the tip, not bad! I was starving, so I downed it within a matter of minutes and it hit the spot! Not a drop left. My only critique would be that the tail was pretty tiny, but my steak was perfectly medium-rare as I requested. Solid casual style place to grab some red meat if that's your mood (which is me - always haha). They even serve other non-red meat options as well, so it's not strictly that.

The prime rib was huge for an 8 oz portion but he received a 12 oz! It was a little dry, but delicious. I had the 8 oz skirt steak medium rare with a Caesar salad and sweet potato with butter and cinnamon sugar. My steak was in between two cook times Medium and Medium Rare. Medium Rare was delicious but the medium was dry. The salad was great. Just enough dressing. And the croutons were crunchy. The sweet potato was too buttery but very good.

"Perfectly 4 stars. The restaurant itself is clean, staff friendly, and more importantly affordable. The prices were amazing. One complaint. The server while nice, was not around to remove the dishes that were occupying space on the table nor did any other staff (multiple people) who kept bringing food had the intelligence to remove them while bringing new food. I felt it was a major issue considering we had to remove the plates ourselves and placing them on another table just to have room. This alone should severely drop the rating, but I am being incredibly generous. Depending on who you are, the occasion (was my fathers 51st), and who you're with can impact the experience. We weren't taking it to the heart. One thing to consider, the environment inside, compared to Outback Steakhouse is much nicer, it gives a better feeling. The parking is usually always packed, we circled around for 10 or so minutes until we decided to find parking elsewhere outside. Again, circling around for another 10-15 minutes. Edit: Would like to add that the Outlaw Ribeye chef's special was the second time I've had it. The first encounter was medium-well, while the second medium cooked. By far, the medium-well was the most perfect steak I've had (beating famous steakhouses like Peter Lugars), but the medium was too much more pink than it should have been. I recommend going medium-well for this menu order. The chicken wings were great. The lambchops (both medium and medium well) were tasty. The porkchops was great, and the ribs were also enjoyably. The dessert we had wasn't that great. In fact, we struggled to finish it because it wasn't too appealing.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

We managed the time by catching up & going over the menu. Our waitress Adrianna was a sweetheart. She suggested items to try & drinks as well. She made sure to give us enough time to place our orders & checked on us when the opportunity presented itself. It wasn't overkill which we were grateful for. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which came with a side. I decided to order Grilled Asparagus & Baked Mac & Cheese as my sides. The Chicken was a tad salty & I think it may be because of the cheese. The Asparagus was suppose to have a Lemon drizzle flavor which I did not taste. The Mac & Cheese came with bacon which I did not see nor taste. The bacon was on the very bottom of my Mac & Cheese. I only know this because I ended up taking more than half my meal home.

Their staff were helpful in describing the different types of cuts and the cooked preferences. I know people who came and waited forever for a table and had just mediocre service and food.  But I have to say , I enjoyed everything and was impressed with the service.  It may have been my low expectations , but I was honestly satisfied. The fried shrimps and fried onions were not oily and had great flavor. Another reason I gave them 4 stars and not 3 is that I left my credit card here and realised the next day.  I called and picked it up .. no problem.  Im so glad nobody stole it.   So ..well this is not really a high end restaurant, but it sits somewhere between an applebees and mid-end steakhouse.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

The other stuff was just mediocre. For our entree I'm so glad we decided but to not spend too much and just get the 12.99 special. Which is a 6oz sirloin, salad and a side. We all got loaded baked potatoes and the potatoes were cold, so was the steak. They were all cooked the way we ordered them but they lacked flavor.

I didn't get to try it but he loved it so much he didn't regret not ordering steak at a steak restaurant. Overall I will definitely come back again.

Food is very good quality every time I go to eat here BUT the employees are not well trained and the place is very disorganized. I have tried multiple items on the menu and have never been  disappointed with the food but unfortunately the poor service and untrained disorganized staff really puts a damper on the eating experience.,3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Oct,24...Just got reply from a very offended server of this place.. listen I work in the same hospitality field..and I love my job..we have different days good and bad but u do your job the proper way anyways.. My company is looking forward hearing all of the comments..it helps u get better at what u do!!.. moreover after every single event every server/bartender gets his own rate.. no offense and don't make it personal.. work hard and harder to be the best !! Good luck !! Original review...Negative: The Host is terrible - we went there on 4th July around 6is pm..hell yeah.. great holiday right?! The Host didn't even look at us..she was on her phone !! What?! Yup and then when we waited for a minute and she didn't acknowledge us.. We told her we wanna sit at the bar ..she didn't look at us again and just said go ahead!! WT* right!! The Bartender guy was good.. Drink were great.. The only thing is that when to sit there u have a feeling that everything is so messy and disorganized!! We didn't even wanna stay there for more drinks even though came there especially to see the place and get the feeling bcoz we live in this area.. Well.. The interior is nice..

"The restaurant is nicely lit with diffuse type lighting. It offers a cozy intimate feel. Some exposed brick work adds to the experience. Service: I had a great server. That's it.... Food: *Freshly baked bread & butter - I had a cup of tea to compliment. This taste so good, u'll destroy any stomach space for entrée. (pace yourself) *Sweet chili calamari - my taste buds were happy, it's well seasoned with a unique flavor. *Caesar Salad - veggies are fresh, crunch held till last bite. *Ribs (side order) - well cooked, moist and complemented my carnivorous appetite. BUT! I'm a rib snob, they were secondary to Applebee's ribs texture and seasoning. *Steak (ribeye) maybe - I don't remember the exact cut, but I know I ate it very slowly with thin slices. Like my steak vampire rare (bloody). Charred, juicy portions. I also had a baked sweet potato with a heaping serving of sugar to induce carbComa. Parking is dependent of peak/off peak times. Verdict: It all comes down to your server. Keep calm, be polite, maintain the experience.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"They have a great service!! Special mention for Stephen who served us politely. I love their bread, it's so soft and easy to chew. I only ate the salad, the bread and a chicken wing, I'm already full. I also love their rice! It could have been 5 stars, however, the steaks were too salty, even the chicken wings. I would advise them to use only a little salt because too much salt is really bad for everyone's health. Hopefully they'll have a concern about this.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
I liked it.  A typical chain restaurant but the food was great.  My steak came out the way I liked it medium rare.  The way I judge a steak house is how red my steak comes out and the price I paid for it.  There are other steakhouses like Peter Luger or Wolfgang but you pay a premium.  And LongHorn is not one of them and my steak came with sides compared to the two I mentioned. THE PARKING sucks.....,5.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"I was here this past weekend came in around 630pm our wait wait time wasn't bad they told us a half hour. Once seated we needed a few minutes to get settled & look over the menu , drinks I tried the Raspberry Ice tea pretty good a bit sweet & needed more ice once I got some ice in there it was great. My friend had the Strawberry lemonade also on the sweet side but not bad. Food I tried the Garlic Parm & Mozzarella steak comes with 2 sides I went with the Caesar salad & mash potato. Nice small salad , I asked for my steak medium rare & it was cooked properly 6oz was plenty for me the steak was good nice & juicy , good tasting mash potatoes. This meal also comes with unlimited Bread , hot bread always a good idea. My friend had the Spinach Feta Chicken , Caesar salad & Baked potato. Chicken was pretty tasty a little bit of a spicy kick to it , good baked potato. We also had a kids meal we were able to substitute the Mac & cheese for the Steak house Mac & Cheese , we got it with fries & fruit. Pretty good Mac & Cheese , cheesy & with bacon not bad. The restaurant itself is a good size small bar upfront , the seating area is spacious & has kind of a log cabin feel & decor to it. Service was good a bit slow but our waitress was very nice. Prices are moderate. For what it is this place was decent nice to have more choices for food in the area.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"Always wanted to try a Longhorn Steakhouse. Firstly, they are none in NYC. Second, they always have commercials and I do not have one in my area! Third, it's another option for the lovely area of Elmhurst. So, Longhorn shares the lot with Olive Garden and Joe's Crab Shack, so parking is minimal. Best to find some side street parking, even if you have to pay for that. (I think the Joe's Crab Shack side has the most parking spaces). Warning: if you really want to eat here without waiting, go on a weekday. So I go with my parents on a Sunday (expecting to be a long wait, which it was) evening, and the host said about 45 minutes, and we said yeah. We killed time doing some errands (even though the sensor buzzer thing would far from the base). And when we got back we waited for another 10-15 minutes. So, it didn't really feel like 45 minutes to me. If you choose to come here on a weekend, be prepared to wait and maybe venture into the mall. After being seated, our server was very polite, patient and attentive. She came and checked in and told us the status of our food, etc. The bread they gave was nice, warm and soft in the inside. We got an app, the corn fritters. Disappointing app. Too much dough, not enough corn. So I ordered the T-bone (medium rare) with cajun rice with shrimp (premium side; costs extra). The steak was correct temperature, but it was salty! Super salty for my palette. (not salty enough to be inedible). It also had pepper and other herbs that added to the saltiness. I guess I rather have the food to have flavor than being bland and overcooked. The cajun rice was nice actually. Flavorful as well. Didn't try any dessert. Overall it's a nice experience. The restaurant is kind of small, so that may be why it's always crowded on weekends (can't take the demand). If you wanted to compare this to Outback which is a few blocks down Queens Blvd., Outback is cheaper and blander (?) than Longhorn. But, Longhorn has more variety of meat cuts and different apps. In terms of price, they're about the same. I wouldn't rule out Longhorn entirely. I think it should be given a chance. May not be the greatest steakhouse, but it's not the worst either.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

We ordered the 18ounce ribeye (~$27) (medium) and 20ounce ($29.99) porterhouse. What we got was two well done and extremely salted slab of meat.

"Just can't believe this longhorn steakhouse became this right now. I really remember that I hangout with friends when this location just opened. Everything is perfect like the ones we usually go in NJ. However, today is my girl friend's mom birthday, so we decide to go for our celebration. When we get there to ask for reservation, it seems the representative doesn't want too many to come. We just simply ask how long it gonna wait. She told me its around 90mims. Okay. So we continue to wait. But another customers just came in 1min later than us and ask same question, they told them 2 hours. We really got shock...  But in fact, we just waited around 20mins then can get in for the dinner. Second, when we arrive at our table, the chairs are nasty and wet. We have to ask the guy to clean up again.  And this guy told me we are so busy and rush. It seems that he want us to clean up by ourselves. Moreover, when the waitress distribute the plates to us, the plates are not cleaned at all. I can't imagine a good restaurant happened this. We have to use hot water to wipe again. Third, the food change a lot. I did remember every time I order the salad, it serve in the bowl. But this time is at the plate and the quality is fewer than usual. Also, my girl friend order a soup, it's NOT hot at all!!!!! The quality and quantity of the foods obviously are disappointed to us this time.

Went last night for the first time. There's a parking lot which is great and we were seated right away.  I had the strawberry pecan salad which was excellent and corn fritters also very good. My friend did not like the soups at all. Main course I had a ny strip steak and mashed potatoes. The steak wasn't seAsoned much and the potatoes were just ok. I ordered it medium well and it was a little tough and chewy. To drink I had a piña  colada which wAs just ok. There was a slight chemical aftertaste like it was made from a cheap mix.

"Service may have been good other days for others but here's how my visit went down. I waited long for my food which isn't unusual since I've been to different branches of LongHorn's but, when I finally got my food I was missing one of my sides and had to ask for it more than a couple times. Around 30 minutes passed and I finished eating my meal (10 oz Salmon was somewhat more salty than I think it should have been) My side order still hadn't arrived. I eventually asked to take the side off the bill. After paying with a credit card they did not return the card until after I asked about it. And finally the server we had was a nice fellow but, he did forget to give my party a few things we asked for. Overall I did not enjoy my time here and would recommend for anybody to not go to this Longhorn specifically.

"I went to your restaurant in Queens, NY. It was supposed to be a chill engagement dinner for me and my fiancé (just got engaged last week). My in-laws sent us money to have a nice simple dinner. It was quite crowded and I figured since we were hungry we could sit at the bar. The ""girl"" who was bartending looked at us at least THREE times and still didn't come over and ask us for water or what we would like to drink. It was 20 minutes of NO SERVICE!!! She did walk over to hug two of her friends and kept saying ""I got you"" ""I'll take care of you"". Yet still didn't ask us if we wanted anything. Now it's funny because all the people sitting at the bar were African American and I (and my fiancé) are ""white""...which I am not. I'm Portuguese and Chinese mix. Another bartender (a young male) walked over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. I said we WERE planning to have a full meal, but now I'm annoyed for waiting. We only got drinks, one appetizer and a dessert instead. I have NEVER been so disrespected. I was supposed to be celebrating this special moment and yet was thoroughly annoyed.

Thats so insane i dont think I'll ever order it again. On to our entrees, I ordered a ribeye and a side of mashed which really was a side of butter since the potatoes were drenched in melted butter I was so disappointed.

"I'm not really a meat and potatoes kind of girl but I do have low iron levels so figured I needed some steak to pump up my body.  That being said, I NEVER EVER order steak at a restaurant.  I'm the girl getting chicken, fish, sandwiches, salads and stuff like that.  A few reasons-sometimes the price, but I usually don't really crave meat.  Maybe that is why I feel fatigued a lot.  Anyway, since I've been at the Olive Garden next door, I've been wanting to try Longhorn.  Joe's Crab Shack is up next. Circled around for parking on a Sunday evening, didn't wait too long for a spot.  The wait was 40 mins, my party of four waited at the bar.  Super crowded overall, I was the only lady thus I sat at the only seat while the men crowded behind me.  Everyone at the bar was ordering food since they were so crowded but we got started with drinks since we wanted to wait for a booth.  I asked for the Jack Daniel Honey, Blackberry Lemonade but they ran out of Jack Daniel Honey.  Boooo.  The bar tender recommended a similar type drink and my three friends ordered Patron margaritas.  They gave me my drink on the house since the original drink they didn't have.  How sweet.  The margaritas were excellent, it was just under $10 for one, but it comes with a refill so the price is right. We were promptly seated and able to take our drinks to the booth.  I noticed that if you sign up for the restaurant's newsletter and text STEAK to some number, you can get a free app.  I showed the waiter and they honored it allowing us to order an app for free that was under $10.  We ordered the firecracker chicken wraps (basically like taquitos) which were good.  We also got the seafood and shrimp dip with tortilla chips which were super rich and tasty. Ok for the food. When I was drinking at the bar, I noticed the guy sitting next to me eating some amazing looking steak with a bone in it.  I promptly asked my friend about that cut of mean and he replied, ribeye so I knew I was getting that.  Only the Outlaw Ribeye comes with bone so I ordered that with their potatoes au gratin.  My friend ordered the sirloin with sweet potato, another the same as me, and another steak (forgot the cut) with a lobster tail and asparagus. Salads and bread came out promptly, then the food.  It was absolutely delicious and I could barely finish it.  I actually turned part of it into a steak sandwich for my friend for lunch the next day and I still have some steak for lunch today over some rice.  I originally wanted to get the porter house for 2 but i didn't realize it was one piece of steak for two people.  Anyway food was good, I don't eat steak all the time but maybe I should. The bill wasn't bad for what we got.  However, the waiter forgot to comp us the app so when we told him he took it off.  Come again!",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"I walked in here with my mother and father and loved it. The lady at check in is very nice. She sat us immediately. Then, our very nice waitress came in no time to give us our bread and to take our drink order. Within 5-10 minutes, our drinks came out of the bar and were delicious. Then she takes our entree orders after serving us our drinks. Within 20 minutes, our Caesar salads came out. They were awesome. After. About 10-15 minutes later, our steaks came out. They were delicious. Except my mother asked for no seasoning. It was too peppery for her taste. But her baked potato and lobster tail were fine. My dad's and mine were delicious. So a little knock there. We told the waitress, shockingly, she didn't have an attitude and took it back for them to make another steak. It took quite a while to make the sirloin. At this point, she finished her lobster tail and potato. Then, the steak comes out. She's not hungry anymore and winds up taking it home. The waitress was quick with the check and we leave.

"Went on a Saturday night at 7pm - BAD IDEA! Not only do they have conflicting rules about calling ahead of time (one day, they say you can call ahead 45 minutes before you arrive to put your name down and when I called last night, another person said that wasn't true), but the staff could have been better trained for more personality. Maybe they were understaffed that night, but there were about five tables available for about twenty minutes while there was a ""50-70 minute"" wait. How infuriating, especially when you're hungry, huh? Our group waited around the bar and there was a black guy in a purple shirt walking around offering people a sample of their onion rings. That was pretty cool! But then I noticed he gave two black females waiting by the bar the whole plate of onion rings and heard them saying to someone, ""oh he just kinda gave it us! We didn't even ask for it!"". Later, I also noticed the same guy offering some coupons to the table next to us (when we finally got the chance to sit an hour and a half later) and the people in that table were also black. Coincidence? Hmm, maybe they should have an asian guy walking around talking to the Asians and giving us some coupons too! BAR: Anyway, there was a female bartender with blonde hair who made the most WATERED DOWN cocktail drinks I've ever tasted. She also had a nasty attitude asking for my ID. I ordered a frozen mango margarita and was given mango juice on ice. If there was any liquor there, I definitely didn't taste it. The other people in my group also said the same thing about their own cocktail drinks. Take note: don't drink their mixed drinks!!! One star off. SERVICE: When we finally got seated, we had to wait another ten minute just for our server to come. And when she finally came around to get our orders... Well, let's just say you can't teach personality. Maybe she was nervous? Maybe she was tired? Maybe she never waited before? Idk, but definitely was not a good impression especially when the restaurant just opened. The service so far from bar to table was pretty brutal. One of the managers actually came to introduce himself, which was nice, but not enough to salvage the service. One star off. FOOD: - I had the 6 oz sirloin with a side of rice pilaf and lobster tail. - The steak was aaaaaaaamazing!!!! One star put back. - The lobster tail was super undercooked. Like sushi style, undercooked. - Ordered beer and a bottle of wine because, you really can't fuck that one up right? (Awkward moment when your server doesn't know how to open a bottle of wine nor how to serve it.)

"The wait was pretty long. We had a party of 8 and even after deciding to sit separately, we ended up waiting 45 minutes. What sucks was that they did not allow reservations so you were basically hoping that it is not the full. The wait was abnormally long because we notice that there was only 3 or 4 big tables, one of which was just two tables put together. The server was extremely friendly but also extremely clumsy. We ordered two best of longhorn sampler for appetizer and because I wanted to be special also a shrimp and lobster chowder. For myself, I ordered a 8 on prime rib with a lobster tail add on and a side of Parmesan mushroom risotto. The  sampler consist of stuffed mushroom, chicken wraps and fried shrimp. The mushroom was easily the best out of the three, and made me wish I order the mushroom by itself. The shrimp was pretty good and you got a lot of pieces but at the bottom, there was too much oil residue. Lastly the chicken wraps. This felt like microwaved packaged taquito that you get from Costco, then cut into two and plated nicely. The chicken was so dry, and the overall wrap tasted like it was microwaved. In fact you can taste it too, because after a while the wrap got really hard, which is something that happens after you microwave. Now comes the bad part, and the reason why I called my waiter clumsy. After we were all done without appetizer, I still did not receive my shrimp and lobster chowder. I politely reminded my server and she responded with a shocked feeling. She said she would check the kitchen for me but I had a feeling that she forgot to put it in the system. 10 minutes passed and then she served me my shrimp and lobster and made a joke saying the kitchen forgot it but better late then never. However.... It was the shrimp and lobster dip and not the shrimp and lobster chowder. I was like.... What is this? I order soup not a dip. I did not feel like arguing though because at that moment, my steak had come, and I was hungry. But then.... Wait for it.... My server forgot my add on of a lobster tail. I had to call her over again to let her know and only after I was 3/4 done with my food did it come. The prime rib itself was delicious. I ended up not being able to drink my soup but the food itself was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but of course I did not expect steakhouse quality steak being that this is a chain restaurant. Aside from the lobster fiasco, which could have been my stars and the lobster's star not aligning, it was overall pretty good meal This place, if based on chain restaurant quality and expectations, could have easily been a 5 star restaurant based on its food alone.

I have a phone case that allows me to carry my license, my debit and my credit card along with my metro card for emergencies so I always assume my wallet is just in my purse but I searched EVERYWHERE (every bag, the car...) for it. Nothing. I started to panic and realized the last time I remember having it was during dinner. Therefore, my husband suggests I call to find out if I left it. Lo and behold, I get transferred to a manager named Abner who verifies my identity and says he'll have it for me when I go pick it up. I go to the location and everything is exactly as it was left. I am VERY grateful I do not have to cancel any of my cards and also amazed at the integrity and helpfulness of both Steven who answered the call and Abner who reunited me with my wallet. Great food, enjoyable and pleasant decor, amazing servers, wonderfully helpful... It won't be my last time there for sure...",5.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"We have been to this place before for a big group party for birthday last year. The service was good but for this week, we had a desapointing experience. We went for a birthday party of 10 people. First, there was no silverware on the table and water but the bread was served. The waitress was rushing to take drink orders knowing that she gave us only one drink menu. I asked if we can get some water and silverware first. I ordered for a bottle of Merlot but the wine was of really bad quality. Secondly, most of the appetizers came so spicy and it didn't state to be spicy on the menu. Lastly, the big desapointing was when the mains came out. Cold porthouse steak and spicy. We didn't want to make it a big deal but only one of us who got her rib eye steak very cold. She called on the waitress and the waitress took it to the kitchen and brought it back, yes brought it completely back...then she resent it back till they cooked a new one and the chef brought himself and apologized. Then the waitress came and appetized too. They took this from the bill. When you pay a bill of $350, you have at least have the basics. Result: unsatisfied and will not recommend.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

The burger I ordered medium well was very well done which was upsetting. But it gets worse. I decided to try out their Wild West shrimp and it turns out they tasted pretty good, but they weren't spicy everything was fine...well until 30 minutes later when I got home and threw up... Something about the shrimp decided not to mix in my stomach.

Welp we didn't have ask, our waiter knew what we were thinking as soon as we were sipping the melting surviving ice water. Prices are definitely reasonable and the place has a cool vibe about it. I see why its in the middle of Olive Garden and Joe's Crab Shack, good marketing trick. All in all, go try it out. Sidenote: Tuesday afternoon seems to be a less crowded day, if you like it that way.

"Absolutely excellent experience at LongHorn last week!  Took my girlfriend here for her birthday since she loves steak and knew we would get a huge portion at a reasonable price. Right now they have a combo for 12.99 that includes choice of sirloin steak, salad, and a side.  The steak was absolutely super flavorful and delicious.  Whatever steak rub seasoning they are using is so good and tasty.  The Meat was also juicy and tender at medium well. The bread also tasted hot and fresh and right out the oven.  Salad and potatoes were also fresh and delicious. For a birthday you will get a free birthday song from the staff and a free vanilla sundae which was also great and funny. Oh yea, the drinks are kind of weak but the portion is huge.  Service was also very friendly and helpful.

Im not one to critique too much but somethings gotta give! first off, our server never introduced himself or greeted us.. he took orders from different parts of the partty seperately as he would leave to tend to other tables. We had to ask for the waters opposed to him serving it while we waited. The list goes on and on but the worst was when everyone got their food but my dad and his partner didnt since they mistakenly gave it to another table.. the nice part was that the manager came over to apologize and comped his meal but this place was overall horrible service at least the server was! the only reason for the 3 stars is solely because of the food flavor.

I enjoyed my ribeye steak which had a lot of seasoning but the rest of our food: cornbread fritters, a porterhouse, a filet, baby back ribs, brownie sundae and caramel apple dessert were just OK. The most disappointing part was the service. While our server was pleasant during every interaction, he swung by our table every 20 minutes! He was not attentive and we were constantly looking for him. We needed to flag other servers to provide us silverware, refills on drinks and to ask for the bill. To top it off, once we got the bill we discovered he handed us the wrong one! We came here for a belated bday dinner and we will not be returning.

"My husband and daughter ordered a steak and it was as small as the palm of my hand I WAS CRYING. It was too funny. They both looked at their plate of food like wtf. However, they both said the steak was delicious. I bet they'll never ever order their food based off of a picture ever again. My 7 year old son enjoyed his kids meal choice. He had the cheeseburger, broccoli, fruit juice, and fresh fruit. He ate everything. He claims that was the best burger ever. My 14 year old loved the cheeseburger... She doesn't eat pork. My ribs were delicious the ""loaded"" baked potatoes were not loaded at all. The waitress went and brought us extra stuffings for the potatoes 2 thumbs up for that. I would have to say all of the food was good. The staff was attentive to our needs. With that said this is a good place to eat, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a family night out for dinner.

"The food was ok they had a good selection of food however the service was very slow w. I get it you have large parties you want to focus on but you have to pay attention to the smaller groups too. The order took forever to come and our waitress stopped by our table 3 times to ask how everything is. I wanted to say if we had any food I would be able to answer it I couldn't bc we didn't have any on the table. Then my soup has no liquid in it. I ordered a French onion soup and the whole thing was bread that apparently soaked up all the soup. The manager was nice and said he would bring a new one with actual soup and less bread but my steak meal came out already so my sad soup got pushed aside . The manager even took the soup off the bill which was very nice. During the meal we got no visits from the waitress. We had to ask the manager for Togo containers as our waitress was busy with other tables the whole time. They bring the containers however our waitresses again nowhere to be found so we have to wait another 10 minutes for our bill. Then when we actually wanted to pay with a credit card we have to wait another 10 minutes for her to come back so she could scan it. Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was nice. There was even a birthday going on at the next table which they gave us a piece of cake for Mike to-year-old. The manager was also lovely he came over a few times to ask how we were doing .

"I usually don't care enough to write reviews but given how far food and restaurants have come in the last ten years, I felt compelled to rant about how AWEFUL this longhorn steak house actually is. Let's start with the service. Our waiter, who was not new to the establishment, didn't know if the restaurant had herbal tea. He even looked like he never heard of it and this was proven when he brought back a packet of black tea. Dirty appetizer plates are left unattended on the table and were only removed if I picked them up and handed them to unsuspecting staff. The waiter and food runners (too many of them) were all confused and wandered around with plates asking patrons where the food was supposed to go. Incorrect items were brought and correct items had to be chased down. Now on to the food... To start, you would think a mixed green salad would have mixed greens in it. It did not. It just had iceberg lettuce. No other greens were mixed into its. I think the chefs at Longhorn have just discovered salt and the love it!!! I don't mind food slightly salty but this was ridiculous. The sautéed mushroom and onions that I ordered with my steak - and which came 5 minutes behind it - were drowning in butter and salt. And I ask you, what is the point of ordering steamed vegetables when they are served boiled within an inch of their lives and doused in butter and you guessed it... Salt. The thing that makes sweet potatoes interesting is that they are... SWEET!! I fail to see why a table spoon of brown sugar on top of the over baked sweet potato is necessary. The only reason I am giving two stars as opposed to one is that the cuts of meats themselves were pretty good and had my ribeye not been crusted in salt, it would have been pretty good. I would avoid this restaurant.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and waited 30 minute for a table for 4. Our waitress was super friendly, however it took awhile for her to get us water, and we being so hungry we had to asked if we could get our free bread. If you sign up for their e-club you get a free appetizer that is of value up to $9.99. I got the calamari which could be better, don't expect some big rings of calamari tho. it was not as crispy as i want it to be. I also tried their corn fritters.. which in my opinion had more dough then corn in it. Our entrees finally came and the presentation was horrible! It is as if they just threw their food onto the plate. It didn't look good to even touch! I asked for their porterhouse to be done medium well and it came out with blood still coming out! another guest at the table ordered the lamb chop thinking it would look like the picture  on the menu, but seriously when it came it looked like they just threw on the plate and scoop some mash potato on the side. On the menu they advertised it came along with spinach and i didn't see any green on her plate. I have been to other locations that was better than this establishment.

"I'm so disappointed in this location. I've had Longhorn in Jersey and it's always been good food and a good experience. NOT SO AT ELMHURST. The only positive thing about this place is the fact that it has a parking lot. My favorite sirloin broth French onion soup was gross here. First of all, the crock was 80% filled with croutons, with so little soup that I had to dig for it. No, it wasn't absorbed by the croutons -  the croutons were DRY and plentiful, just sitting in a crock with cheese smothered all over it. Secondly, the little bit of soup at the bottom wasn't even warm, it was a bit cold and nasty. The cheese at the top wasn't even melted thoroughly. How this catastrophe of a French onion soup even made it out of the kitchen is a mystery. The strawberry pecan salad was swimming in raspberry dressing. It made everything taste overly acidic. My parmesan crusted chicken wasn't crusted. More like just grilled chicken with mozzarella thrown on top and sent out to serve. The ribeye my husband ordered was swimming in butter with a huge pat of butter still melting on top. He ordered it medium rare. It was medium well on one side and downright still bleeding on the other. It was so peppery, not seasoned correctly at all. The first table we were seated at was a booth and it stank of vomit! We requested to be moved. Luckily we came early during lunch so we had plenty of other tables to choose from. Another thing is, the women's restroom had NO cold water! It was scalding hot water or nothing at all. What is going ON at this Longhorn? Not a single thing was done right here. It's a shame to even put the name Longhorn on it.

The manager even came over to speak to us, and he was great. The second time, our waitress' personality had the dimensions of a blank paper. She barely smiled, we had to repeat almost everything 2-3 times...very in and out kind of style afterwards. The food wasn't good. It just wasn't the same. Are there different cooks that rotate? Did they change cooks? We left unsatisfied and still hungry. We walked over to Mama's Empanadas and ordered some food to take home. If I had written a review the first time, it would've been 5 stars. But after the second time, it was somewhere between a 1 and 2.

"Honestly...my guess is that the majority of the folks that have rated the LH steaks great either have never tasted really good steaks or have never tasted steaks at all (other than cheap ""carne asada"" flap meat at your cheap local ""Carneceria"". Our party was there for a birthday party and ordered various cuts of steak...2 prime ribs, a flat iron, a sirloin and a filet...along with a none meat eater who ordered the salmon. The flat iron was true to its name (not in a good way)...it was flat and dry (even when ordered medium rare). Both prime ribs were blackened/seared on all sides which...for folks familiar with prime ribs (especially when ordered rare and medium rare, respectively, unless a request is made specifically to do so) you DO NOT do so.  And no, no one requested blackened/seared prime rib...or well done prime rib.  And to top it off, both prime ribs were extremely salty...so much so that one of our party could not even finish an 8 ounce order. The filet was also ordered medium rare and when cut in the middle was completely brown.  For anyone not familiar with filet mignon cuts, the prime reason that makes the thick filets so pricey and desirable is because of its juicy soft meaty center.  What we received was more hockey puck that filet. The salmon also tasted extremely salty, almost like it was heavily marinated in a salty soy sauce glaze. And we each separepately questioned that the ounces ordered were indeed what we received.  Having had plenty of 16 ounce cuts of prime rib, the size of the slab I received was closer to 12 ounces. The service was wonderful and deserved plenty of stars but we were there for the steak, not the service, and honestly would have preferred a rude wait staff with great steaks, than vice versa, if we had to have one or the other. So...if you don't know any better about great (or even good) steaks, by all means, you might actually like it.  But if you want great steaks, go to a real steak house.  If you want good to ok steaks, perhaps try one of the other chain style steakhouses.  If you want questionable steaks cause it's close to the mall and your party is steak ignorant, then it's fine here.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"Not a long wait, good service, fantastic Piña Colada, DELICIOUS corn fritters, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Not much more I could ask for from a chain restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter. I will definitely be coming back!

"The food was good. Experience was terrible. They have a parking lot for their own customers which I parked in, because I was a customer. When I left after my lunch the people working in the lot TOWED MY CAR. They expected me to pay $125 to get it back. If I can't go to a restaurant and not have to worry about my car disappearing while I'm eating there, it is not worth going to. The incompetence and ignorance of the employees was unbearable. They even accused me of ""playing games"" and using their lot to park in to shop in the mall. I was standing there with leftover food in a Longhorn Steakhouse bag and hey attempted to keep my car from a Saturday to a Monday. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. It's unfortunate the restaurant has to rely on these people to handle theirs clients vehicles, when clearly they cannot.

"First time: The wait wasn't as long I thought it would be. I guess it must've been since we came almost at closing time. I ordered the crab & artichoke dip it was EXTREMELY GREASY. Pina coladas was great! Then my steak came. I ordered the porterhouse for two. It should have been cooked medium. But what I got was well done. it's a steakhouse...isn't their specialty supposed to be STEAKS?!..Along with that complaint, the steak was supposed to come with their house steak sauce...the waitress apparently says their out of it. How does a STEAKHOUSE RUN OUT OF THEIR OWN STEAKSAUCE. I'll probably only come back for the pina coladas..pretty much the only thing I enjoyed.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"That's it... I am a HUGE fan of Longhorn Steakhouse! Just some background on the Longhorn Steakhouse chain: Back in 2011 the company had big expansion plans set in place for this steakhouse. There were a few impediments along the way. Fast forward to 2014, it seems that these Longhorn Steakhouses are popping up everywhere in New York. There is one under construction at Cross County Mall in Yonkers, NY and the most recent addition in the metropolitan region is right across Queens Center Mall in Queens. Last night, I actually got to try a meal at Longhorn after hearing my boyfriend rant and rave about it for weeks now. Overall, - This Longhorn Steakhouse location is conveniently located within walking distance of public transportation. You can take the M or R to the Woodhaven Blvd station and immediately get out on the exit to your right. - It's also located right next to Queens Center Mall if you want to go shopping before or after a meal here. - Parking here can be extremely limited since the lot is shared with Olive Garden. You might be circling around for a bit during the evening hours. - The wait time was less than 5 minutes for a table during the evening. - They have a variety of different cuts of meats with explanations of what makes each cut different along with how you can order the meat (well - warm pink center, medium rare - red center with some pink, etc) on their menu, which is very helpful. If it's your first time visiting a steakhouse this can be very informative. - My specific waiter was a sweetheart and extremely attentive. Always made sure to pass by our table and ask if we were okay or offer more bread. Kudos to the great customer service! - Before your order is brought out they do bring out unlimited amounts of their honey wheat bread. It's fresh, warm, and extremely delicious. Don't eat too much of it though so you have room for your steak! - I ordered the T-bone steak medium, which is seasoned with a dry rub instead of steak sauce. You really get to taste the flavor of that rub seasoning as you bite into your steak. I love my steak with a little fat in it so this was the perfect choice. If you want more of a marbling to your steak than the rib eye steak is another great option. - Along with your steak you get your choice of a salad (house, Caesar, etc) and a side. The potato & leek gratin is a great choice if you like cheesy thin sliced potatoes. The mac and cheese is also a great side to order. It's topped with breadcrumbs and has a gooey warm creamy center, which is how I like my mac and cheese, personally. I see myself going back in the future to try a different cut of meat along with a different side. Plus you don't necessarily break the bank enjoying a good steak meal here as opposed to going to a private steakhouse in the city. Great meal, great service, which is the perfect combination for a good dining experience.",5.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"My mom and her boyfriend had dinner at this location a few hours ago. They frequent this restaurant at least once per month. The service is usually fair, and the food is always exceptional. However, this was an abnormally negative night. They came in around 9 pm, and were seated within 15 minutes (despite being forewarned about a long wait time). They sat down, and their waitress arrived and took the orders. When she returned with the water, food orders were placed, including: an order of chili cheese fries,  a black & blue margarita, a diet coke (no ice brought out with ice), the porterhouse for 2 (medium-well done), side caesar salads, & rice/mashed potato as their side. While they waited for their side salads, they anticipated the usual complimentary bread & butter appetizer. Unfortunately, it was a no-show (-1). The fries arrived first, crisp and tasty. Next, the salads came, and they were good, especially being as hungry as they were. The entrees were brought out with the respective sides. They reminded the waiter that brought out the entrees that they never got their bread. They began eating, realizing they didn't get the ""house-made sizzling steak sauce made table-side"". When they asked why they didn't get any, their waitress explained that they didn't have the hot plate necessary for the sauce (-1). They were brought some warm sauce soon after. All two slices of bread arrived. Midway into the steak, there were pink regions. As they ate more, the meat was brighter and much too raw. They notified their waitress, and she verified that they indeed ordered their porterhouse for two to be made medium well done. However, the photos show more of a medium done steak. The waitress asked why they ate so much if the steak was not cooked to their liking, to which they replied, ""we were so hungry, we ate whatever was cooked. This was at the end"". They already complained about the absence of bread, sauce, and the soda with ice. They didn't want to add to this growing list, but unfortunately this was unacceptable (-1). The waitress asked if they wanted to see the manager. She said yes. The manager came out, and apologized for the less than spectacular service and orders. Mom took pictures while the manager apologized. The manager asked if they were going to ""bash us now?"" to which mom replied, "" family and friends come here"". Only after pictures were taken did the manager seem moved enough to reimburse them for the poor visit. She agreed to place a 25% discount on the bill. They also did not charge for the diet soda. She then informed them that they should have told her before they ate so much that something was wrong with the food. They paid the bill and left with an uneasy feeling in their stomachs...whether that was from the food, service, or both, is yet to be known. We're very thankful for the actions made to improve the stay, but this visit was particularly bad, failing to meet minimum expectations for a decent night out. The food is delicious enough to return, but this won't be for some time.",2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

Very pleasant in front of us and...lets just leave it at that. I ordered the sweet chili calamari. unfortunately calamari was very dry and the sweet chili sauce...it was just super sweet. We originally ordered the porterhouse for two, but unfortunately they were out. That was disappointing. We definitely did enjoy the fresh bread that they offer. My gf ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the rib eye. Both cooked nicely, but one thing I did not enjoy was the amount of butter spread all over my rib eye. Do I prefer Longhorn's over Outback?

"Went opening weekend - ordered a steak medium - wife ordered medium rare ... Took some time to get them but when it finally came my wife's medium rare was hot and mine was stone cold - they offered to refire it (a big no no for food cooked to temp - it would overcook at that point).  Second gripe that night - no offer of steak sauce at a steak house ? Seriously?! I should not have to ask a bus boy for steak sauce, it should have been offered once I was served -- manager made amends in the end. So tonight we gave it another go ... 1. Got my steak and it was sitting in a pool of already congealing oil/grease. 2. Still no offer if steak sauce, had to ask another bus boy. 3. No one cleaned the table ... We had bread plates, our appetizer plate & our salad plates stacked on the table when our entrees were served, we had to push them to the side so the wait staff could fit our steaks on the table. 4. they placed a napkin under the fries - it soaked up some of that congealed grease that my steak was bathing In - and then it  stuck to the steak, YUCK!!! 5. And the biggest screw up, my son ordered a prime house burger without mushrooms because I am allergic (which we informed our waitress of) ... Thank god I didn't eat the portion he didn't finish because it was loaded with mushrooms -- to which the waitress stated, ohh a few must have slipped in.  That mistake could have cost me serious illness or worse.

"Two stars for our awesome service ... That started 17 minutes... Yes 17 minutes after we were seated.  Five servers walked right by us, two were on cell phones at a POS station and when our lovely lady greeted us, she informed us that she had no idea whose section it was but that she would take good care of us, and she did.  She was excellent. 25 minutes into our experience, water was dropped off, but our promised bread kept going to another table that already had bread on it??? Next, our BEEFSTEAK Salads weren't even made with Beefsteak Tomatoes.  Rather, they were translucent slimy thin plain vine tomatoes (see image), the bacon on them was cold and limp, and the lettuce was just tossed on the plate... And the Hidden Valley Ranch with smoky tomato essence... Horrific.  I asked for balsamic at the guidance of our waitress but my date asked for the Tomato Ranch so that we may properly taste it.  The Croutons were amazing though!  My Ribeye was ordered at med rare and came out before my salad was halfway finished and was thin, scary, and cooked medium well... Our server apologized again and  took it back while my date ate his very delicious and well plated Lamb.  The lamb was tender, not Gamey at all and was drizzled in a minted juice that was lovely and sat over a delicious horseradish mashed potato with wilted spinach... bravo on one dish!  Too bad I hate Lamb :(  ... My steak came back an acceptable Medium. ( NOTE TO THE COOK: Medium rare is charred on the outside with a cool, deep red center.)  The steak was well seasoned, marbled beautifully and tasted pretty good!  Im a snob when it comes to Steak, as I was born and raised in Wyoming, and ate Steak at least twice a week.  A Steakhouse should pride itself on proper meat temps and it seems like the Lamb won that battle tonight.  Again, our server was attentive and apologetic and even brought me another baked potato!   All said and done, the MOD approached the table and profusely apologized for the entire experience and took responsibility for our wait and for the overcooked steak and bought the whole meal!  THAT was unexpected and very sweet.  Excellent Customer Relations Management and high praise for George!!!  We asked the server to charge us for an Iced tea so I could tip her and she did so after much coaxing from us :)  I tipped $18.00 on what wouldve been a 44.00 bill because our meal was free and because of the excellent service and great Manager.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"We came to celebrate a birthday. We came in today a Monday, and we had an aweful experience. The waiter was good in the begining, got all our orders, even though there were eight of us he was able to take all our orders, even when two people where talking to him at the same time. Appetizers: the appetizers (calamari, soups and shrimp)were good, but it goes downhill from there. Dinner: aweful, aweful, aweful... not one, not two, not three orders messed up, each and every order was messed up. It had nothing to do with how the order was put in, but all about how the food was cooked. The only thing that came out right was the ribs order that came out great. The burger was order medium it came out charcoaled on both sides of the burgers and it was cold. The second burger came out plain, when it was order with all the fillings and cold, then in an attempt to rectify the situation they took it back to make a fresh burger, but instead they just heated and add the fillings, and then gave it back. Seriously, the burger was already dried/burnt and cold, that's what was being served, fine we just tried to leave it at that, and just return the burger as it was inedible. Then comes 4 prime rib steaks, and they were ordered medium and med well, we had a pregnant women 6 months, and all the steaks were pretty much still dead (rare)and cold, even though we order medium. Then on top of that, they forgot or failed to make more than half our sides. On to the drinks, the first round of drinks were good . The only thing was that when we ordered the second round of drinks, they ran out of the glasses in which the drinks originally come in, and in doing so, we were shorted our drinks. They tried to say it was the same size, but when we emptied the second drink into the orginal cup from the first round we had, turns out it was much less drink for the same price. Overall the drink was good despite being shorted. Then we brought our unpleasant experience to the managers attention, Travis. He was a nice gentlemen, who tried to address the situation to the best of his abilities, but to be honest. When your kitchen staff messes up this horrible, the patrons should recieve a lot more for the inconvenience, especially when celebrating a birthday and having not one but 7 of the 8 patrons meals messed up completely, when everyone was starving and excited to have a great time at longhorn as we have done so in the past. Yes the manager Travis decided that an appetizer/dessert coupon would suffice for a horrible evening, with food being eaten out of being completely hungry and not wanting to waste more time to have the food go back to the kitchen to come back out incorrect once again. It was not and these are 8 patrons who will definitely not return back.  More should have been done for the horrible experience, to have 8 people return on future occasions but instead, that will be the last time we come to Longhorns. Lastly, some other waitress had brought food to our table, that was not our food whatsoever and caught an attitude as if we were interrupting her day, by explaining our unpleasant experience to the manager as if it was her table. She was not our waitress, and should not have had any input whatsoever. Yet felt the need to have a nasty attitude, as if we were ruining her day. Totally uncalled for and disgraceful. Overall a really bad experience for a unbusy Monday, for a small group of 8 to have such an aweful experience.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

I chose the strawberry and pecan salad which came with mandarins and grapes as well. I wasn't too fond of the cheese. Our steak arrived soon after and it was AMAZING.

Went for my brother-in-law's birthday. Anything that could go wrong....: Missing appetizer Unorganized order taking - told ahead of time we needed separate checks - they disregarded it They didn't know who ordered what so utter mayhem when all the food came out. (One of the staff members slammed one of our meals on the table because we were confused with who's plate that was) My steak was cooked wrong and so was my brother-in-laws - they switched the cooking of our steaks so we started eating when everyone had finished. Last but not least.... when it was time for the bill... we waited a FULL HOUR for them to bring us our checks. We were going to walk out. And their excuse was - we have to go through your bill and sort out the separate checks. Had they paid more attention to the fact that we asked for separate checks as soon as we sat down...we wouldn't have to wait an hour for the check. We had 2 waiters. I hate that I forgot their names but one of the waiters (man) was a mess he's the one who ignored our split check and wanted to take orders his own way. The other waiter (girl) was great. I felt so bad for her because her partner waiter and the kitchen staff were just making her work harder and take all the heat.

"My mom wanted to take me out for my Birthday dinner, so I decided on LongHorn Steakhouse. I thought it would be like Outback or Boulder Creek, but I was wrong its a lot better.  When I walked into LongHorn I was pleasantly surprise with the nice decor, it was more upscale than other franchise steakhouses.  The wait wasn't long at all since I went there on a Thursday night, but there were a lot of people at the restaurant.  The service was very good and we ordered the drinks and appetizers.  Afterward, I decided I wanted to eat the 32oz Porterhouse Steak, which came exactly as I wanted, Med Rare. Usually a lot of the franchise Steakhouses can't get your Steak cook correctly.  So, I was very happy with my dinner at LongHorn.  I would definitely go back to LongHorn again.  The only bad thing is the parking lot is always full and hard to find a space.  You might need to park your car at the Queens Center parking lot and pay for your parking.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

Went during HAPPY Hour.Tried the steak sliders& chilli cheese fries that was on the prime time menu.Which was on the salty side for me but my friend had like it.The Wild Wild West Shrimp is always delicious(without peppers)! The crab cakes could've been fried harder but it was good.Now to the drinks.Strawberry Margarita &mojito was delicious . Pomegranate mojito was a no for me (tart).So basically a star was taken away due to the salty prime time menu items I purchased.,4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
"I Just have to say that I love steak!!! And can say I'm pretty much awesome at identifying a good piece of meat. Let me start by saying that the waitress was very attentive and nice she took our drink orders and they arrived pretty fast.  The perfect margarita was actually very good! I ordered the 6 oz renegade sirloin with mashed potatoes and salad. If you are into more of a dry meat with good flavor order the renegade sirloin, but if you want a juicy and flavorful thick piece of meat order the ribeye. Overall the service was good, the restaurant was clean , and the food was good and arrived (as drake would say) real quick.  I probably will be going back real quick!",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse
To management and LongHorn corporation. Kitchen and bar area need to be inspected. We dined here on Friday night and I am sure that the terrible experience came from Longhorn because we had our previous meals home cook. We both end up suffering all night vomiting and having diarrhea. We should have taken the warning seriously because the bar area had a strange smell. It smelled like something had been rotten somewhere around that area as soon as we entered. I do not think I will return to this longhorn. I hate to give 1 star but the experience is beyond lesson learned.,1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Went back again tonight.  This time had the Ribeye.  Very nicely cooked and seasoned.  Our waitress Tootsie was very helpful and professional.  My only gripe tonight had nothing to do with her, but when we arrived, the floor of the booth I requested was clearly not cleaned prior to us being led to the table.  There were crumbs and fallen food all over the place.  I am guessing they had kids at this table earlier.  I pointed the mess out, and the greeter immediately swept it up.  I know it was a busy night so I understood since it was quickly remedied. Other than that, it was a very nice experience. Coincidentally, Sapphire, our previous waitress brought us our food from the kitchen.  She immediately recognized us, and said hello, which was very nice.  We felt like we were visiting with friends :) Tootsie was also very sweet and accommodating.  I wasn't surprised to find out these two young women are actually related.  My kids love coming here and the food is way better than average for the area.  We just need to find out what time of the day is the least crowded because the wait is getting increasingly longer every time we go.",4.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

Boyfriend got the Feta Chicken and he liked it quite a bit. We got the Chocolate Stampede for dessert because it was my birthday. It was absolutely amazing!

I expected the steak to look bigger, because of the price, & where I was. the mash potato (side) was the size of an ice cream scoop. the shrimp & rice dish came w/ 12 medium size shrimp, on top of a small bed of rice. the amount of rice we got was ridiculous, you could see half the plate. the bread they give you in the beginning was nice, & helped to fill you up. service was very good, but I came to eat, that's why we go to restaurants. disappointed, probably won't go back.

My pregnant daughter decided she wanted to go have dinner here for her Birthday.  We called ahead and it was useless we still waited 40 minutes to be seated right front of the kitchen. Mind you there were two pregnant females and a toddler in our party. I had bought a cake at Conti's Pastries in the Bronx to surprise my daughter. Spoke with the greeter who took the cake to the refrigerator and told me just tell the waitress when you get seated. I told her and she told me no problem. After we ordered It took about an hour and a half before we got our main course. When we got our main course the baked potatoes were raw and was missing a side of broccol. We told the waitress and she brought us another raw potatoe but no broccoli at that point I was just not going to bother with another raw baked potatoe even though it was for a pregnant woman. I just asked for mash instead and reminded the waitress about my broccoli. As we are finishing up and I'm waiting for the waitress to get my cake. I see my cake go to the table next to ours with a different waitress and I'm telling her it's mine as she totally ignored me leaving my cake at the other table. She finally returned to retrieve the cake to take it back to the kitchen and at that point the surprise was ruined. I just told her to leave it at our table spoiling all of my effort to surprise my pregnant daughter. The manager came to my table but I really don't think he understood the magnitude of their negligence. In my opinion the food is over priced for the quality.

The service, though our waiter, Travis, was nice, was not so great. We never got any bread to begin with; it took at least 10-12 minutes for him to get to us due to the large area he was serving; and he served me the wrong salad.

This place only recently opened and I think the hype for it is a little exaggerated. First every time I walk by after work people are literally driving in circle in the tiny parking lot which is shared with Olive Garden and Eat at Joe's. The weird thing is that they have muni-meters that at one point it looked like they were strongly enforcing. I briefly saw if you stayed parked there for 3 hours it's $51. I can only imagine someone driving there and getting a spot and waiting 2-1/2 hours to eat only to realize they have to pay additional money to enjoy their meal. Anyhow on to my experience the place wasn't crowded so we walk in the hostess took us to our seat which was a small table with bar stools my girlfriend requested a booth and the host said there weren't any and they were about to close. She went to check for a table and never returned so we both agreed to sit at this table. Our waitress was friendly and courteous but the food had much to desire. The shrimp appetizer we ordered seemed like it had a fight with a huge bottle of Wesson oil. It was very oily yuck. Although my girlfriend loved it I couldn't finish it.  Sometimes I think she'll eat dirt and enjoy it too. I hope she doesn't read this or I'll be in the doghouse for weeks. The main course was easy to forget I can't remember what I had.  The ultimate question is did I enjoy Longhorn? The answer is no. Will I be back the answer was is no? If all Longhorns are like this then please stay out of NYC.,2.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

Newer restaurant built along that strip between the LIE and the mall. Decent for what it's worth. When you walk in the place is actually really nice looking. All pretty modern and clean with nice big booths and tables. The food is mediocre and pretty pricey. We went for happy hour and even the happy hour appetizer deals were pretty hefty in price.  Also the happy hour appetizers are pretty tiny so between the price and size your prob better off going with a regular full priced appetizer item. I got the burger (forgot which one) and coming to a steak house in retrospect should have gone with a steak but it was pretty bad. Way over cooked and on a stale bun made for a burger that my dog would have loved.

"So this was the first time we ate at Longhorns. It was my wife, son, and my mother-in-law. As soon as we entered we were welcomed with this huge odor that smelled like urine and cheese. I looked around the crowd to see if anybody else had a similar reaction but I guess it was just me. The hostess sat us down and the server introduced himself to us and asked us if we wanted any drinks. After we ordered, my wife seemed bothered about something. She told me that there was a stench that smelled like pee. This was exactly what I smelled and asked my son if he smelled it too. My son told me that he was the one that mentioned it to her. We decided to eat there anyway being that the other customers weren't bothered and this scent might just fade. We ordered the shiitake, ribeye, and a couple of renegades. The portions seemed very small but the food was delicious. Even the mashed potatoes and vegetables we ordered were mouthwatering. The server was great..kept coming back to see how things were. As we left the smell slowly  subsided. (Maybe we got used to it) I don't know if it was the carpet or how well they bleach the bathrooms but the smell was definitely there. Maybe it was a one day thing but if I ever walk through those doors again and get hit by that same odor, then I can assure you that that will be the last time I ever go back to a Texas longhorns again.",3.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"this has been the worst experience at a restaurant i have ever experienced. as soon as we got in the restaurant the hostess was really nice..no issues.. gave us options because we had to wait about 20mins for a table. which my friend and i were ok with that cause what restaurant doesn't have a wait on a saturday. but as we sat at the bar we received no service for about 30mins. we ended up going over to the hostess to make sure we weren't waiting for someone else to take our orders. the bartender finally took our orders for drinks. but never came back for another 20mins to get our food orders, while waiting for the bartender to come and take our food orders i then just decided to ask the hostess for a table cause i didn't feel like we would be served anytime soon. when we sat down the waiter was really nice..but when we look at the table the plate had food dried on it. and my friend had something floating in her water..after waiting another 30 or so minutes we finally got our food which was not correct but the waiter corrected it..but a couple minutes later one of the bus boys came by with one of the items that my waiter already gave us..and when i told him we already got that item he shrugged his shoulders and left it there. at that point me and my friend started laughing because we couldn't believe everything that happened. we really tried to be understanding which is why we stayed for as long as we did but at the end of everything we had to speak to the managers because it was just too much bad that over weighed the bad. the manager did his best to try to correct the situation for us,but as it was our first time ever going to the longhorn chain we don't think we will be going back. food was not bad but everything else left a bad taste in our mouth.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

"On Saturday 6/6/15 we came here for dinner and I called first to ask how long the wait was the person who answered said there was no wait for 2 adults and an infant so we get there only to find a huge crowd of people so he lied which I didn't appreciate because he could've been honest and we would've made other plans. We were seated and we looked over the menu our stroller was folded and taken away from us. We were given a highchair. We ordered an appetizer and we were told they don't do substitutions I'm allergic to shrimp so she leaves asks mgr and we were given double the chicken wraps. The service was very poor no silverware or enough napkins. My boyfriend asked for silverware since our waitress couldn't be found he had wind up getting it from someone else.  I got a potato cheddar soup which tasted terrible it was too thick almost resembling cheese whiz with bacon bits and pieces of potato in it.  Our entrées were the renegade steak with mashed potatoes they were terrible weren't well seasoned poor presentation of food potatoes looked stiff I took a bite of mine and I sent it back told waitress I wasn't happy with it and she says flat iron steak is a better choice I asked for it and medium well it tasted but also bloody I finished up paid the bill and left.  It's a shame because this is a steakhouse you'd expect steaks to be prepared well the wait is ridiculous no call ahead or reservations not worth it for the bad service and poor food quality you're better off going to outback steakhouse in the Queens place shopping center they have a call ahead list which can be done even through your cell phone or by calling directly.

"Since joining yelp, there is only been one (1 star) review in my reviews and this makes 2. Its a terrible way to celebrate my father's birthday. It is our first time here and it was a bit upsetting. Its 9:30 and have not been seated. ive been here since 7:30 and still waiting. I can't believe the wait. My brother even video recorded and timed the wait to see how long it's been. We were all saying to self that it better be really good food for a 2 hour wait. Finally we were sitted and the tables were set up poorly. A square table put together with a circle table. I havent seen a mismatch since eating at a dive in chinatown. The appetizers were less than par, we couldn't eat them because we had no plates. We ended up eating on the top of the rolled up napkins that the utensils were in. My brother in law had to get up and ask for plates. By the time we got them, we're were practically done. The sampler looked like someone just poured slop on a plate. The calamari was covered in pepper. The Tonion was so so. Then came out the salads. The salads were rushed, chopped and very little to no dressing and the croutons were just poured on top like a cereal before milk, so that was not great. Then came the main course. I ordered the 16 oz prime rib and came out looking like an 8 ounce comparing to the 18 Oz outlaw my brother ordered. My wife and mother ordered the 12 Oz and looked like my 16. Something is totally wrong here. I cut into the prime rib. And it was dry for a medium rare. This is even after I pour the au jous. I've had outback 's prime rib and I have to say I can already see a difference let alone the taste. The rice pilaf wasn't rice. It was salt. The rice tasted as if they were in a rush. Whats the rush, besides the fact we were last and closing time is upon us in 20 minutes after a 2 hour wait. Grandmother was really disgusted. That says something especially when she rarely complains about food. Even if the food was par she wouldnt complain. This however was a heart attack meal. It was salt dinner. This hyped up place was a total let down. Especially for my father and his 55th birthday. All he was talking about was to try the new longhorn out and eat some good steak. He has heard of the place but never been. Hell, my entire family never been. And after this tragedy, never will. The only thing that was good about this was the decor. A 400+ dinner for what I consider a fast food restaurant instead of a sit down. I'm no Gordon Ramsey but even a blind man with taste buds can tell, this place needs to be checked out by its owners and based on other yelpers reviews I was not alone in believing this to be true.",1.0,"92-30 59th Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373",LongHorn Steakhouse

My son and husband ordered a porterhouse of two which they both enjoyed, my daughter had the 4 cheese pasta and I ordered the sirloin with bacon and cheese. All our meals were delicious.

Still waiting, we were then told they ran out of one of our steaks, at this point we already waited for almost 40 mins.

It took the staff about 15 minutes to get the tables cleaned and more people seated. Very inefficient. Maybe they are short-staffed. We waited about 10 minutes for a server. Initially Nick was very attentive but after he took the order for our entrees, he disappeared. It was very annoying to have to keep looking for him and flagging him down when we needed something else. The food was very good, especially my sirloin steak. It was prepared exactly the way I ordered it. The drinks however are very watered down. I had a margarita and barely tasted the alcohol. That seems to be the way chain restaurants serve drinks. I ordered the mushroom parmasean risotto but they ran out. My son ordered mashed potatoes and we were told they had run out of those too but still brought him his order.

So my boyfriend asked how's the appetizer doing because it was already 30 minutes into the night and we still didn't get appetizers the waiter replied sarcastically we're backed up because it doesnt look like we have your appetizing then our dinner finally came out my boyfriend dinner was cold and my dinner was hot then he finally brought the appetizers and said we'll take care of it it was full of grease .

"I feel that you should not go to this longhorn steakhouse for a few reasons. One reason is because they mess up your orders. For example, me and my family went and were really hungry, so my mother ordered a 12oz New York strip steak and mashed potatoes, and she received something different. They went and tried to fix it and it took so long that my mother did not get to eat. And she was craving this steak and mashed potatoes. So we walked out and everybody ate except my mom.

The Story: I came here on a Saturday after spending my whole black Friday making cookies at home for the holidays. Treat from the boyfriend for a job well done. (he knows I need to eat yummy food or I'll be grumpy) Food: I ordered the porter house for one medium rare with a side of shrimp chowder soup and a blackberry iced tea. The steak was cooked nicely and it was not tough. I love their blackberry iced tea and soup was very flavorful as well. Price: You'll expect to pay $25 per person at this place (or so our host [Joe] says). Definitely go here over than the outback a couple buildings down Route 17. Decor: They have a bar area and a big waiting area. The dining room is huge - definitely come here if you have a big crowd. Service: Our waiter Kyle was exceptional. He refilled our drinks when it was at 15% full and I thought he had forgotten the ketchup but he remembered. Parking & Finding the Place: Located on Route 17 N by the Burger King in Rochelle Park.

Had the pleasure of coming here the other night for a yelp event and that allowed me to really get a good look at what they had to offer. The drinks here are off the hook! I got two strawberry margaritas because they were just so damn good.. and it has rock candy in it (how can you go wrong?) For appetizers we were started off with: Wild west shrimp Spicy chicken bites Sweet corn fritters Crab & artichoke dip My favorite out of all of them was the crab & artichoke dip. It was served nice and hot with homemade pita chips for dipping. The consistency was really nice and thick with a lot of crap meat all throughout and EXTRA cheesy. The sweet corn fritters were my runner up being that they were so addictive and delicious with a slight crunch on the outside with a soft interior. The wild west shrimp were ity bity little shrimp breaded and fried and served with spicy peppers and served with a cooling sauce. The spicy chicken bites reminded me of boneless wings and I enjoyed those a lot. Up next they offered you the option of a soup or salad. The soup being the chicken tortilla soup with avocado and sour cream drizzle I decided on the salad. I ordered blue cheese dressing thinking it would be good but it was that really strong blue cheese taste that I did not enjoy unfortunately. For dinner we had the option of picking from 6 different entrees: Flo's Filet Outlaw Ribeye Renegade Sirloin Blackened shrimp & cajun rice Parmesan crusted chicken Long horn salmon with side options of: Loaded idaho baked potato sweet potato with cinnamon sugar and butter Fresh Steamed Asparagus Steakhouse Mac & cheese I ordered the ribeye and the sweet potato after speaking to the waiter and he recommended both of my options. My steak came out piping hot and cooked to the perfect medium. The steak itself was flavorful and juicy just how I like it. My sweet potato was amazing with a hint of sweetness. I loved every second of eating it. Once we digested a little bit the waiters brought out the dessert! The chocolate stampede and the blueberry lemon butter cake. OMG both of these were decadent and amazing. The chocolate stampede was so chocolaty with a moose like filling. The blueberry cake was lighter than the chocolate stampede and had a light lemon taste to it. Both enjoyable. My experience here really opened my eyes to what Long Horn Steak House has to offer and I will most certanly be back for round 2!,4.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse
"Came here on friday night. Did not have to wait long for a table. The waiter was very helpful and nice. About the atmosphere, when we first enter there was a uncomfortable smell in the restaurant that disappear after 10 minutes of seating. Our appetizer of texas tonion came quickly but there was too much batter therefore the onion was not crunchy. Our entre took a long time to come though. We waited really long but our group didn't mind because there was a Pokemon go gym stop there. For entre, I chose the steak frittes medoum done, with parmesan garlic fries and caeser salad. The steak came in a decent portion. I liked the ends where it was less bloody. The fries was good but was salty. My friend got the grill chicken with asparagus as a side. The portion was terribly small. There was a few thin stalks asparagus and it was an cost extra. The chicken was nice and tender and not dry at all but there was only 1 mushroom... which i found unreasonable since it tasted really good. There was also a side of baked sweet potato which I do not recommend with extra sugar cuz it overpowers the good taste of the potato. The sugar came with a ridiculous amount of cinnamon on top too which we just poured out. Another friend got a burger which he said was very good and believed to worth the $14.99 price tag compared to the grill chicken. The fries was a huge portion therefore could not br finished.

"I had a $25 gift card from an Olive Garden yelp event, from a few months ago, that I haven't used. I figured this was as good a time as any to make good use of it. Since LongHorn is part of the Olive Garden chain, I was able to use my gift card here. I came here a few times for takeout. Twice for lunch and once for dinner. I was able to stretch the $25 gift card to the max, with coupons. I got a pretty good sampling of their menu. For lunch, I tried two different versions of the half sandwich and soup. One was a bacon burger with French onion soup and the other was the sirloin chimichurri with French onion soup. Both were good. Between the two, the sirloin chimichurri was the winner. The burger was good, but nothing really out of the ordinary. The sirloin chimichurri had a really good taste to it. The sirloin mixed well with the chimichurri mayo and the provolone cheese. The Texas toast added a good flavor to the sandwich. For dinner, I tried the 6 oz renegade sirloin. The entree came with two sides. I got a baked potato with the works, as side one and rice pilaf, as side two. With a coupon for signing up on their website, I was also able to get a free appetizer with any dinner entree. I tried the housemade spicy wings. The sirloin was okay, but it was a bit dry. The two sides I got were also okay as well. The housemade wings, which can be a meal on its own, were very generous in portion and had a good sauce, that added a spicy kick to the wings.",4.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Extremely disappointed with this place. As it states on this app ""call ahead to save your spot on line"" I called ahead by FORTY MINUTES. I get there the host/waiter (young guy, blonde hair working tonight at this time) told me I still had to wait 40-45 mins. I said I called ahead and he tried to tell me I called recently (without actually checking the time). I told him I called over 40 minutes ago and then took out my phone to show him. He ""confirmed"" and saw that I did in fact call 40 mins ahead. However, he STILL tells me 40-45 min wait. I asked him what's the point of calling ahead and proceeds to tell me well everyone calls ahead and I would just have to wait. I will NOT ever visit this longhorn location ever again. Why advertise something that you do not offer? Always a 40-45 min wait- this was my third time trying in a 6 month span. This time I thought I would get a decent wait time because we called ahead- APPARENTLY NOT. Terrible customer service. Additionally when I called, I asked how does calla head work I was told it would make my wait time shorter. I asked what's the current wait time?

I'm just baffled why it would cost more at lunch, especially if we came about an hour before dinner service started, you really are going to charge me more for the same meal? The bread was nice and warm and the steak was so juicy that it made the broccoli side even better to soak in. I was so stuffed I didn't have room for dessert.

"""Hi-ho, Silver! Away!"" Please tell me someone knows where that line comes from.  Well let me just tell it anyways.  It's The Lone Ranger's catch phrase every time he wanted to gallop away with his horse, Silver.  It's the quintessential cowboy catchphrase and I couldn't help but hear these memorable words when I walked into LongHorn Steakhouse.  My first time visiting LongHorn involved coming back from a shooting trip in Pennsylvania with my best buds many, many years ago.  Since then I had not stepped foot into any of their restaurants until LongHorn held a very generous Elite party.  I had such a great time and loved the food that I knew I would come again to taste the deliciousness once more. So now let's get to the meat of the review.  Haha see what I just did there.  Anyways this particular visit was special because it was my good ol' dad's b-day celebration.  He's a man that likes a good steak and based on what I had tasted in my previous visit I knew that he would absolutely love LongHorn.  We started with some drinks.  I opted for The Perfect margarita because of how much I enjoyed it last time.  This time around it did not disappoint once more.  For the appetizers the LongHorn sampler was the only choice.  It has the Wild West Shrimp, pretzel sticks, and Firecracker Chicken Wraps.  The shrimp were breaded nicely and spicy cherry peppers gave the dish a very nice kick.  The chicken wraps are supposed to be spicy but I felt it lacked the heat its namesake wanted to convey.  The pretzel sticks were warm and the dipping sauce that went with it (bacon honey mustard!!!) was to die for.  Easily the trio made up one of the best app samplers I've had in quite a while. Here come the pièce de résistance--The Outlaw Ribeye.  18oz of pure bone-in grilled flavor to the max!  My dad and I ordered the same thing and I could tell by his quiet smile that he was thoroughly enjoying it.  I got to try LongHorn's ribeye at the Yelp event but this time around it was even better.  The flavor was there, the steak was perfectly cooked the way I wanted, and my sides of broccoli and sweet potato couldn't have been a better accompaniment to the beautiful piece of meat in front of me.  I knew that LongHorn would deliver as I expected and I left with a full belly and more high praises for it.  I know a good steakhouse when I try one and this LongHorn has made it to one my top favorites.  As I write this review I cannot wait until I make another visit to indulge my inner carnivore once more.  Alas I think I need to gallop back there soon again...

"Went there in hopes of getting a good steak. And we did!!! Not only was  it good but it was delicious!!! Cooked to perfection and full of flavor. The side of mashed potatoes were also yummy because they were simple, weren't loaded with a bunch a fancy overwhelming ingredients, just a simple basic old school scoop of buttery mashed potatoes. The steamed broccoli and asparagus came out very nice, not over steamed and mushy... Just enough crunch. The seasoning of butter and lemon complimented them very well. I also order the strawberry margarita, which was sweet and refreshing. We didn't get dessert, too full but next time we will!

This was my first ever visit to a Longhorn Steakhouse. It was a Sunday at 12:30pm. I took a stool seat at the bar. I usually don't go to steakhouses but I had a $25.00 gift card and this was the one Darden restaurant I've not yet been to. I ordered the 6oz Flo's Filet which came with a choice of Caesar Salad or House Salad. I chose the latter with honey mustard. I also chose a side of mashed potatoes. There was no music but I enjoyed my meal while watching Golf Channel and team bowling on ESPN.  Jamie was great and obviously had some regulars there that day.

"I always want to try Longhorn, while I went to school at Binghamton U, we always went to Texas Roadhouse to celebrate friend's birthday ( well..there are not too many fancy restaurants in that area, and Texas is pretty "" fancy"" one I would say..lol) , and I guess since then, I just fell in love with steak. After I moved to North NJ, there is no Texas roadhouse in my area, but every time I drove by R17, I noticed the parking lot is usually packed in the LongHorn and I assumed it should be good and worth for a try! So here I am, I went to the restaurant last Friday night with my bf. We arrived the restaurant around 8:45 pm but still some people waiting. Luckily, we didn't wait too long ( less than 10 mins) before they called our names.

Bread and salad are very good, too. I love the bread served is warm and fresh, and the salad salad is fresh roman lettuce are coated with dressing well. I ordered 18oz Outlaw Ribeye since most yelpers recommend it, it is good, too. For the price I paid, I am pretty happy about the quality of meat I got and no compliant about it at all. I might eat a bit too much breads so I didn't finish all of the steaks and brought most of them home. Oh, the steamed brocolli on the side is also very good, too.

The only thing that makes me sad about this company is that they took off the homemade steak sauce from NJ locations! That just makes the steak taste so much better.

The service here sucked, and I'll never come back for this reason. I mean to start with there is nothing incredible about this place and to top it off the service was absolute shit. My waitress was this young blonde girl with a sour attitude and a stank face the whole time. She was rude and uninterested in us. I saw her a total of two times in the duration of time I was there.

She told us about the specials on the menu & came back to check on the table every so often. She was absolutely wonderful and I would definitely come back here again.

Skipped any apps cause the food came with bread, salad and a side. He got the NY Strip medium well (ugghhh, I know but he won't order less than that!) and thought it was really good. I had the sirloin and got it cooked medium rare as I ordered but the meat itself was a bit tough but I guess when you pay $15 for it you can't expect to get top quality. Service is good and prices are decent for your run of the mill steaks served at these type of steakhouse establishments.

Prime rib was cooked perfectly.  Hands up it was the best prime rib I've ever had.  My friend's steak was also perfectly cooked.  If you want a wonderful steak, prime rib dinner don't think of any other place to go.  Steer your vehicle right to this Longhorn.",5.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse
"Hubby and I were really in the mood for steak a few Sundays ago, and going to LongHorn was a tough decision to make. Unfortunately our experience with LongHorn Steakhouse at this location varies, and have I mentioned before how much I can't stand inconsistency? When it comes to food we usually go with what we're ""in the mood for"", and if i'm in the mood for great steak and get mediocre steak, i'm not going to be a happy camper...can I speak for the masses here? The first time we went to LongHorn's we loved it! The steak was great for steakhouse steak and the customer service was amazing. The second time we went the customer service was still awesome, but the steak was terrible. We decided to give it the third ""make or break it"" try this time, and unfortunately I doubt we will be going back. I would like to say they lacked during their busier times, but two of three times we went they weren't that busy. I can't point out why the inconsistencies, but for $60 on two entree's it's not worth it, and can be spent at a better steakhouse. Unfortunately we were both sick shortly after the last visit which is a complete deal breaker. I'm rating 2/5 stars because aside from the MAIN DISHES they do have other menu options that are pretty good and the customer service is great.",2.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse

It looked as if it was steamed. I did order it medium rare, maybe the grill wasn't hot enough.

"Ordered from here a few nights ago and was not pleased to say the least.. My bf went to go pick up the food and came back some really awful food, he even compared it to Applebee's, which in our opinion, is horrible as well. I wasn't super hungry or really in the mood for steak, but we had a gift card and figured we'd  try out their other dishes. I ordered the spicy chicken bites and they were not as expected. The menu described them as crispy chicken tossed in a spicy sweet chili-ginger sauce, they were dried up chicken nuggets thrown loosely into a container with dipping sauce, and an extra added bonus of an anonymous gross, little shrimp (See pictures.) They had no sauce on them whatsoever, and were as basic as your average Mcnugget.  My bf ordered a half rack of ribs with french fries and a garden salad. He said the ribs were just ok, nothing he would expect from a steakhouse though. The fries were ok too. The salad was basically bagged salad with not even a cucumber or tomatoes in site, so basically lettuce. My daughter whose 2, got a side of macaroni and cheese and is super picky about food. She wouldn't touch her food and I wondered why. I looked at and tried to pick up a fork full of macaroni and the whole container of it lifted with the fork. It was a solid mass of congealed cheese. It tasted good but was gross. My daughter refused to eat it. I also ordered a baked potato with all the fixings. They gave me a container or sour cream mixed with cheese and bacon bits ? I couldn't even tell. I wanted to put only a little sour cream but the cheese was all mixed in. So my potato sucked. I'm sorry but how can you mess up the most basic of food? To top it off whomever packs up the to go bags, gave us regular silverware from the restaurant!!! I will drop them off tommorow.

The high rating here is based off of the food and our server Joseph being top notch professional. The only suggestion I have is order simple things from the bar side. Like beer or simple mixed drinks. We ordered a margarita and it was not up to standards and when we sent it back the bartender and one of the servers who seemed like a friend of hers made negative complaints out loud about our disappointment in the drinks. Take lessons from a client who is in the high end retail business any comments you would like to make keep to yourself. Clients should never hear any negative comments from workers the customer is always right whether you agree or not. The server and management handled the entire situation very professionally and that is why this review is not negative. If it was based off of the bartender and the negative comments about us not liking the drink it would be a 1 star visit 0 if it was possible.

"So -- been wanting to go to LongHorn for a while, finally got 2 friends to agree to take the trip out to this one which is the closest from my families house. 1) The wait was very quick to get seated.. Already a good sign 2) The waiter came up almost immediately and got our drink order right away and answered some questions for us about appetizers. (I have to be very careful with a seafood allergy I have and he knew what was in each dish we asked about) 3) He came back quickly with our Strawberry Lemonades and took our order for our meals. He had a great personality and we learned he was from FL and moving back very soon, he was very sociable which makes the experience better since it wasn't one of those waiter you sometimes get that try to get your order and food out to turn that table quickly he was patient and help convos with us. 4) We all usually get steaks Well Done (raised as children to get them always like that) but today we decided to go with Medium Well (which we have on occasion) 5) The steaks came out PERFECT! -- Cooked very warm on the inside with slight pink throughout. I had a T-Bone and my friends both got a New York Stripe -- everyone at our table kept talking about how good and flavorful the steaks where! 6) The waiter kept up with drinks for the table (I drink a lot and refills were provided quickly) Will be coming back as this is a great Steakhouse -- surprising since it's a chain... but it was a memorable experience.

"Had a birthday dinner here last night after so many years of wanting to go to this particular Longhorn-  because we live in Rockland and unbelievably this is the closest one. My wife and I went to Longhorns in DelRay Beach FLA and it was to rave about. I am happy to say so is this one and even better! We arrived on a packed Saturday night but thanks to my daughters ""pre call"" our wait was toned down from the hour plus to about 35 minutes. I recommend you call in advance and get that treatment too. They wont reserve but you get on a list as opposed to walking in and waiting longer. We had the Longhorn Sampler and Chicken bites to start and they were all incredibly tasty- we downed it with huge goblets of Sangria and I had the Montana Mule and when you come in and they have this concoction- go for it! The drink menu is unreal and check out their special concoctions! As someone before me said ""off the hook"" drinks. For dinner it was a Flo`s Filet  and Renegade Sirloin with lobster tail- parmesan crusted chicken any my NY Strip and not a complaint around- my wife also got one of the best French Onion Soups she ever tasted and thats high praise. All were cooked to perfection and tasty and tender. WE got the loaded baked potatoes and if anything they were not as ""loaded"" as expected or hoped for. The steaks were good sized as we know what to expect from the oz..on menu. The tail a bit small but also expected-it was just a side- but nothing disappointed any of us. If you know what you are ordering -you know what to expect( as for tails -well its not a seafood place). The service was perfect and attentive and the timing on the meals also perfect -allowing ample time between each. Our server was exceptional and friendly and attentive in a hectic setting and was always nearby. The setting is nice and lighting is low and that helps make it a cozier feel- the place was packed but the volume never reached and ear piercing level and for such a crowd that was surprising. The look is pure Texas but missing one thing- an authentic stuffed armadillo! WE had NO room for desert but can imagine how good they were based on what was on the menu.

"3.5 stars - pleasantly surprised! I'm going to get in trouble with the bf for giving an evil chain restaurant a good review, but it was quite good! My friend and I got the T'onion as an appetizer and really enjoyed it. Much better than the outback bloomin onion because it was cooked as individual onion pieces - so no raw chunks and it was much easier to eat. It was underseasoned but still really yummy with lots of onion flavor. Big enough to share with 3-4 people easily. My friend's filet was tender and made her instantly smile. She got it paired with steamed veggies (which rocked BTW) and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was pretty good - I loved that they used cavatappi pasta. It also had bacon mixed in, which was delish. They were out of my prime rib, which made me sad. I ordered a ribeye in its place, which was pretty good and cooked perfectly. It had a pretty great crust on it. Oddly, the butter that restaurants often melt into the steak was still puddled on top, which was slightly disappointing. However, it was good. My ceasar on the side was a bit weak, but as noted above, the steamed veggies were awesome (cut big and not overcooked, seasoned nicely - zucchini, squash, carrots). Dinner was around $60 or so with tip - no alcohol. The waitstaff was terrific - if I have one criticism, it's that they're too happy and enthusiastic. It felt genuine though, so no complaints! I have enough leftovers for at least a full other meal!

"The first thing you have to remember about Lognhorn's is that it is a chain. As such, you can't walk in expecting world class food. With that said, I have found the food here fairly good and at reasonable prices. We go to this Longhorn on a fairly regular basis because everyone in the family happens to like their ribs. Our most recent trip was last Sunday by request of our son who was celebrating his birthday and wanted the ribs for his B-day dinner. We arrived about 7:30 pm and had about a 15 wait despite having called ahead for call-ahead seating. The wife ordered a steak, the kid a steak with a half rack add-on and and I ordered a full rack to share with the wife. We all ordered the asparagus. One of the reason we all like this place is the asparagus.  I'm not sure what they do to it but it is really good. Well worth the extra $1.49 they charge for it . And in the years now that we been ordering it, I can not recall any deviation in the quality. The steaks were fine , cooked as ordered and tasty. The ribs were quite good as always. The service was OK.  Our waitress was as attentive as she could be considering the crowd but it took some time to get her attention for beverage refills.

"LongHorn pumps out the same Select and Choice steaks that you'd find at Black Angus or Outback.

"When a server describes the special house seasoning as ""sawdust"" you know you're in a bad chain restaurant! My parents for some reason love this place. Now while I would never criticize their aesthetic tastes (After all they paid for my dinner LOL) this just doesn't measure up. I had a rib eye steak that was bland and uninspired. Too much fat, not enough meat but it was cooked right so 1/100th of a star LOL. The service to be fair was quite good. The server took the time to explain to my parents and I different specials and was very friendly overall. It's the only reason this place gets 2 stars. Atmosphere is faux western. It's like ponderosa but much more tacky. I wouldn't come here again unless my parents wanted to treat. Even then I probably wouldn't go back.

"Longhorn like the other fellow Yelper have mention is a chain restaurant  so don't think you will be getting a amazing steak here, but for a chain steakhouse they definitely are better than Outback but still can't compete with others. I stop in about 2 days ago and order Wild West Shrimp for app and it was good but definitely didn't have the kick and spicyness they mention as I hardly taste much kick in the shrimp, and the full rack ribs along with asparagus as a side and amazingly the asparagus was really good, but i can't say the same for the ribs as I have eat alot of ribs and the best one is the one that you chew right off the bone. Don't get what I'm saying? The ribs was too dry and not enough flavor and even with the extra sauce on the side it didn't bring out much when I pour it on. But overall it's good but I think I will stick with the steak next time I come here.

"Am I having a deja vu??? I can't believe I've found another place that serves fried cheesecake all in one day!! Where was I before??? This is too crazy!! ...And I thought it's such a new discovery when I ate it this afternoon at Aki!! I've heard of fried oreo and fried twinkies, but I had no idea that fried cheesecake isn't the newest invention, especially If a chain like Long Horn has it! So what's next? Fried jelly? Fried tiramisu? Just fry anything!! Anyways, don't worry, I DID NOT eat another fried cheesecake today. I know my limit, LOL. What did I have instead? This was my first time to dine at Long Horn, so I didn't know what to expect.  I had sirloin steak salad (my version of ""healthy meal"", LOL) which was a lot better than I expected, the steak was tasty and tender, and came with blue cheese crumbs (I recommend vinegrette dressing!). I think the salad was less than $14, and it fills you up! I wasn't planning to have a dessert, but I gave in to temptation yet again (What's new, haha, I have no will power!! *sigh*) and shared caramel apple gold rush AND key lime pie, which were just ""OK"" (but definitely key lime pie was better). I got angry at myself that I wasted calories on just average desserts.  I should've ordered fried cheesecake instead if I'm gonna compromise my non-existent diet anyway!

"Prime rib steak had nothing fire grilled about it at all and was over cooked. We had a side of seasoned fries and it tasted like regular cafeteria fries with no seasoning just way too much salt. The shrimp and lobster dip was too cheesy with orange oil all over the sides. The dish included canned shrimp and two small pieces of lobster. The chips that came with it were drenched in oil and only half of them were actually crispy. The mixed greens salad that came with the entree was basically iceberg lettuce with thousand island as it was very difficult for me to taste the chipotle sauce. Only good thing I can say is the honey wheat bread and we had a very attentive waiter. For the price you pay here it simply isn't worth it. Overall, don't come here expecting great food.

"This Longhorn in particular will mark the 2nd time I've ever been to Longhorn. I went for the first time a few weeks ago in upstate NY and really enjoyed my meal, so opted to go again in jersey. I don't normally like steakhouses because I don't typically eat steak. I also had the preconceived notion that steakhouse chains such as Longhorn were interchangeable with some of the less-than-favorable steakhouses that have graced NJ in the past... a certain Sizzler rings a bell. So I go to Longhorn and get their parmesan crusted chicken... it's excellent. I don't know if there are others out there who get dragged to steakhouses with their meat-loving friends, but if you do, definitely go for this chicken. It's a little cheesier than I expected, but it is one of the most tender pieces of chicken I've ever had. I do have to say that I didn't care for their shrimp & lobster dip... however, I don't like shrimp or lobster.......... so I guess that's mostly my fault. btw... what the heck is that a picture of????",4.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse

Let me start with the awesome going to good: - Side Potato that is smothered with cheese and bacon is just so awesome in taste and how they cooked it. this side complements any sandwich you order - BBQ Rib is great, that  crunchy fried onions in it compliments the sandwich - Roasted Sirloin should also have that fried crunchy onion in the sandwich. that red pickled onion (if that is what it is) does not match the grilled steak flavor. i suggest that if you are planning to order this. make sure you tell the waiter to put the fried onions...that will be on the 'awesome' category for me - Shrimp and Lobster Chowder is ok, if you are not into peppery/spicy food, make sure you tell the waiter not to put any ground pepper on it. for about 4-5 spoonfuls, you will taste that its becoming too peppery this is not my first time in Longhorn, i love their Outlaw Ribeye and this is the reason why this place have 4-star!!!

Where do I begin?! this past Monday we dined in. They have an appetizer called the Wildwest shrimp. We get it every time. It took forever to get the order and usually they are very prompt. When the order came out it was literally just breaded shrimp with a few jalapenos on top. They did not even sauté it in the wild West mix. I ordered my steak well done and it came out rare. I had them take the steak back and when it came the second time it was still pink. Normally I can handle a little pink so I kept it but by the fourth bite I literally wanted to throw up from the taste of blood. The manager was nice enough that day to take off my stake. The waitress saw on my face that I was pissed off.  My sides came out cold to begin with and our food took forever. Today I ordered takeout. Granted I called at 9:50. I asked if it was too late to place an order for pick up. The lady took my information and said it was okay be there by 10. My husband was rushed over there and we only live five minutes away. When he was knocking on the door they said he had to be there by 10. he showed them the phone and told them it is only 957. He called me at 9:58.I called the restaurant and someone kept answering the phone and hanging it right up. I kept calling back and the manager picked up the phone. I explained to him the situation. If they really did start cooking my hamburger at 9:52 it obviously would not be ready by 957. This means they never put it on the grill. If they could not do it they should have said no from the beginning and I would have understood. Instead they made my husband go out of his way for nothing. When I brought that up to the managers attention his disrespectful responses set me on fire! This is not the type of service I am used to from them.

We got a pager and only had to wait 5 minutes!  This time we had the steakhouse dinner special for two for $25.  We both had the spinach dip, Caesar salad, and renegade sirloin.  The spinach dip was a little salty.  The steak and mashed potatoes were delicious!  For dessert, I had the chocolate stampede, of course!  It's still the best!  I didn't get a birthday candle in it this time.  Oh well.  We were stuffed to brim.  The portion sizes were perfect for the special.  Any more and we would have to take home the rest.  The dessert size was huge.  I made sure to take the rest home.  l gave this restaurant 4 stars because of the wait time and the appetizers being a little salty and average tasting.  Oh and our waiters for both times were great.  They always checked on us to see if we were okay but not to the point of being annoying.  I would definitely go back for their steaks, that's what they're known for...and the chocolate stampede.",4.0,"160 State RT 17 N, Rochelle Park, NJ 07662",LongHorn Steakhouse

"Yard House- been a few times and food, drinks, and service have all been consistent. Large beer selection and something for everyone on the menu. Both times I have been to this location were later in the night around 10pm and the restaurant/bar is still full of people. Favorite appetizer hands down is the Poke Nachos! Crisp wonton chips with very fresh tuna, avocado, scallions, jalapeños, and a spicy mayo sauce. Has some spice to it but they are delicious! People next to us at the bar noticed we had gotten them and had to ask what they were. They got them as well and loved them. My friend got the Korean BBQ Wings and has now gotten them every time he's been. Good flavor to the sauce which starts off sweet and then gets a kick of heat to it. Big enough portion size too. In the past I also tried the Baja Fish Tacos after noticing someone at the bar who had ordered it and they didn't let down. Great flavor, crisp fried fish, and tasty slaw on top. Overall great place to go for food and beer with a good atmosphere for a sports bar and friendly staff at the bar!",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"After a long drive, my friend and I had a taste for some delicious burgers for dinner. I tried Yard House in Indianapolis and I was dissapointed, so I thought I give a try again, maybe my opinion would change. I wish I could provide more stars, but once again I was not impressed with the quality and taste of the food. The atmosphere was great, the wait wasn't long, but the waiter was missing half the time. I had to grab the attention of other waiters to get our waiter. Even though it was dinner time, I shouldn't have to continue to wave down other waiters to get service. I order a side salad, bbq bacon cheddar burger, fries, and a strawberry lemonade. The side salad was bland, the burger was extremely dry, but the Strawberry Lemonade was sooo GOOD!!

"This place really fell off. I used to love going here. The past few times have been blah. I went this Sunday (7/1) and the service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress greeted us and told us she would be back to take our order and 13 minutes passed before she came back. She kept getting lost and wasn't attentive the entire visit. It took forever to get our check. The portions are tinier. Really tiny, see picture. We complained because we have ordered the boneless wings many times, and the portions weren't this small. There was barely any sauce on the wings. Didn't get the extra blue cheese I ordered. A few of the other things we ordered were off as well. The manager was nice, but his excuse was the ""The kitchen got a few boneless orders in @ the same time, & this one came out smaller, it happens."" Huh?

The hostess staff was friendly as well and accommodated the booster seat request with ease. They also had an option for a high chair if we were sat at a table. Food: I had the vegan burger with garlic fries the vegan burger was good and the garlic fries were good as well.

"I came here with a large crowd on a early Sunday afternoon. They seated us after about 10 minutes of waiting, not bad. We had 2 servers, Taneisha and Freddie,  good, but a tad confused.  My husband ordered a pint of beer, never got it. They didn't communicate with each other well and so we got a pint and the tall glass but had to return the pint. My daughter's fries were also forgotten, we mentioned it, got them and then got another order of fries by mistake, again. I ordered 3 tacos, the vampire, baja fish tacos, and chicken chipotle. They were not good at all. The vampire had a shell with fried cheese that was over fried, dry and too chewy.  The taco was bland as well despite the sauce and the tomatoes n cilantro. The only taco that semi tasted good was the baja fish tacos. My husband ordered the rib eye and grilled shrimp, medium rare. The rib eye was cooked to perfection but also bland. The shrimp was big but also bland. For appetizer we had the onion ring tower, also bland and oily. They need to come up with a good seasoning rub for their food. Their pomegranate  margarita was great tho! Strong enough and so yummy. I had 2!! For dessert, I ordered the mini creme brulee with caramelized banana, it was not that great. It was cold and the crust tasted burned, not crispy.",3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

Boisterous as opposed to loud. That means people are having a good time rather than just talking loudly. Why not with a tremendous selection of beer in yard tall glasses a good time is on the menu. Food was also surprisingly good with many Vegan and Gluten free choices. Being a total carnivore I had a grilled pastrami sandwich with Jalapenos so they know how to cook for my kind too.

"Decent experience for my birthday here. Myself and my sis in laws birthdays are tomorrow. We decided to come here rather than our original plan of Havana Central. Their prices are a bit high but their food is good. Our waiter, Johan, at first seemed to be a bit upset and maybe a bit rude? We initially asked for waters for the entire table and in turn received our drinks first. Waters came like 20 minutes after we sat which I was upset about. I'm an avid water consumer. I also received regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that I asked for and then was charged for an extra sweet potato fries. Johan turned out to be really helpful and good. He removed the extra charge of sweet potato fries. At a point he went on break and came back looking more chipper and happy which was a good thing for us. It was a nice experience. 3 our of 5 stars because of the errors. He was also very patient with us as we asked him last minute if he can split the check. He did it without a problem.

"Alright, so I guess I've checked into this place way too many times and have yet to write a review. Yard House is your staple American restaurant that stands out with it's beer selection and the sizes of said beers (i.e. half yard). The food is decent. As this wasn't my first visit here I tend to have my favorite meals. Originally, I loved their southern fried chicken. This meal included a beautifully fried boneless chicken breast set on top of a spinach mashed potatoes, which in turn was laid in a delicious bourbon gravy and creamed corn.  Unfortunately, they changed the entire presentation of the meal which I believe made the meal less appealing. On the other hand, the Wisconsin fried cheese curds are great. I don't think I can add anything else to that statement. The Nashville chicken meal which includes sweet potato pancakes, pickles and a slightly spicy ranch sauce is pretty ok. The big issue I found was that the chicken was not spicy at all. The entire definition of a Nashville chicken is for it to be spicy. The chicken looks the part, but once you taste it, there's zero spice. I know some restaurants change their recipes due to feedback from patrons, but come on. If someone says that a spicy meal is too spicy then they have no reason to be eating said meal in the first place. Bring some spice to that chicken please!!! The beer selection has a lot of variety and the service in particular for this last visit was great. Our server was very personable (Erin). Not to say that I've had bad service here. In any case, I'll continue to visit as I do enjoy this place.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"I never thought I would become that person who would considering ordering a salad as their entree dish, but here I am -- and I'm totally satisfied with my decision. I ordered an Ahi Crispy Salad and I recommend the smaller size because it's a well portioned size (as seen in my picture). I was definitely full, but that could also be because I shared a Mac-N-Cheese with my boyfriend. (Note: the smaller mac-n-cheese size is more than enough to share with someone else if you're each getting your own entree. Also, please specify the size to your waiter bc we didn't and ending up getting the larger ""adult"" size, which was waaay too much food) Regardless, the Ahi Crispy Salad was delicious. I love how they added the crispy noodles, which added a nice crunch, the tuna was good and the sesame salad dressing was a nice compliment. I honestly liked my salad more than the mac-n-cheese. Yard House also has a bunch of beers available and they offer each person 2 complimentary samples. So definitely take advantage of that before picking one!

"The Yard House is a Rocker Sports-bar combo that is also appropriate for all ages and promises for fun times and good food. Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is amazing.  Tons of TVs and plays rock and alternative music.  It has a bar-like vibe, yet is perfectly appropriate for people of all ages.  (Of course, don't seat the young ones directly at the bar) Menu:  The menu is absolutely huge over 125+ selections (excluding drinks and dessert), if you can't find something here then I don't know! Vegetarian/Vegan Friendly:  Yes and yes!  There are plenty of vegetarian selections and for both veggies and vegans.  There is a Gardein menu (veg meat substitute)- please note though that the meat sub is vegan, but some Gardein selections are vegetarian due to the use of cheese (but they now also offer Daiya, hooray for the vegans!)  Aside from the Gardein there are also other options including salads, tomato bisque soup, and grilled cheese (amongst other options, of course) Service:  The service is friendly, kind, and caring, but super slow.  I am unsure if this is a front or back of the house issue (but could be both).  The slow service is the primary reason for the four star review as opposed to five.  The other reason is once in a while the food won't be hot enough, but this is due to the slow service.  The wait staff also seems to take a break every time I come (but they always have someone take their place), regardless of the time of day I come. Food:  I love the food.  Today I had my two favorite dishes- the fried mac and cheese appetizer and the Gardein orange chicken with jasmine rice (you can also get brown or spicy rice!)  Absolutely delicious.  Everything is so extremely packed with flavor, it is truly amazing.  Beware though, apps are expensive at Yard House. Dessert:  I have not had dessert here in a while, but my favorite is the mini peach cobbler- super delicious. Overall:  I love this place.  I always feel super relaxed as a vegetarian coming here.  I would say anyone should feel super comfortable eating here regardless of dietary restrictions (of course, people with food allergies please tell your server).  My only two cautionary tales to take-away are expect slow service and to be there a while, and that the appetizers are very expensive and it may be more worthwhile to do a main course and dessert- or just a main course.   If you want apps- consider sharing across the table, which is what I always do.  Enjoy",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

The host was great as she welcomed us and let me pick where I would like to sit.  The problem started after we sat down.  It took 10-15 minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence in the restaurant.  No offer of water or soft drinks and especially no offer of one of the many draft beers available.  Finally a person came by and said I can take your order, but I'm not your wait person.  She then joked that she was trying to get fired tonight so if we could help with that it would he great.  I'm honestly not 100% sure it was a joke.  Anyhow, food order came out wrong, and throughout the entire meal no one came back to check on us.  We actually wanted to order more drinks and food but was unable to do so.  With this being a chain restaurant the obvious problem is with the staff.  The staff not being attentive is a direct reflection on the lack of management that must take place in this location.  I will never come back to this location and maybe never walk into a Yard House again.",1.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"As far as chain restaurants go you can certainly do worse. As far as chain restaurants in Ridge Hill, you probably won't find anything better than Yard House. I've been a frequent patron at Yard House for years now. Visiting at various days and hours, from the busiest of Saturday nights to the random Wednesday right after opening. Service is hit or miss, but whether you are the only customer there or one of many on a full house, I've always felt the food to come out a little slow. Because of this I would recommend ordering appetizers if its in your budget and if you're very hungry. Entrees can take upwards of 45 minutes to come out, so it's nice to have something during the wait. As with most chain restaurants I believe in this golden rule: The more complicated a dish sounds, the worse it's probably going to be. There isn't the highest level of quality control in the kitchen, and the cooks seem to lack the finesse or training to create the dishes and flavors that the menu tries to deliver. Stick to your burgers, sandwiches, and creamy pastas and you'll be fine. Some of the dishes I can recommend are: Chicken Nachos: Crowd favorite, and hard to mess up, even a stoned college freshman can pull this off. Portions are huge so share with a group Poke Nachos: Poke is the flavor of the month right now and I don't particularly mind. This appetizer is much smaller than the chicken counterpart but futures a more refined and daring twist. Fried wonton ""nachos"" and topped with Sushi grade tuna, nori, truffle oil, spicy mayo, and jalapeno. It delivers the familiar experience of a spicy tuna roll or a poke bowl in the vessel of nachos. The textural contrast keeps it interesting. BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger: The number one safe, ""I don't know what else to order"" chain restaurant option enjoyed by millions of Americans worldwide. A classic for a reason. Kurabuta Pork Burger: I was impressed to see that Yard House procures their Berkshire pork from the highly regarded Snake River Farms. For those of you unfamiliar, with Berkshire (Kurabuta Pork) it's a much more flavorful and tender variety of pork that is specially raised by accredited farms. It is often referred to as the pork version of Kobe Beef. Lobster Garlic Noodles: I don't know what it is about chain restaurants and pastas, but they are certainly one of my most guilty pleasures. Please don't tell me Italian friends. The lovely mound of carbs and fat is loaded with assorted seafood like crabs, shrimp, and lobster, as well as mixed in with spinach and shitake mushrooms. The sauce made of butter, garlic, and parmesan. It's heavy and you'll probably have to bring half of it home, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. No Yard House review would be complete without acknowledging their extensive beer menu. It's fairly diverse and offers plenty of options. While their selection is a little basic, I do think they are a good entry point for people just getting into craft beer. I also found most of the staff knowledgeable enough about their beer menu to offer some good suggestions. Yard House isn't bad by any means. Outside of the relatively slow service and sometimes overly ambitious menu, I think it's a pretty decent option. It's a 3 Star for me, the epitome of an average dining experience. However, due to the complete deficiency of any half decent restaurant in Ridge Hill this could easily be a 4 if they clean up a bit.",3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

First they didn't have our reservation, since the place was empty this wasn't a problem, but the five people at the hostess stand took their time getting us a table; they clearly couldnt care less (15 min standing there waiting for our table) Then it took an hour to get our table drinks, forget getting water. We sat for close to an hour with no food, drinks, water. Finally decided to speak with the Manager, he was nice and pulled through for us (got our drinks). Then the waitress spilled one, and it took another 20 min to get that drink replaced (we had to ask the manager again).

"I had reservations with my family on a rainy Saturday night. Large restaurant with a modern decor and distillery in the back near the bathroom. They have a large selection of beers and a Late Night Happy Hour of specials starting at 10pm. Elvis was a great server, very friendly and accommodating. He also gave a lot of suggestions for items on the menu! I ordered the Awestruck Hibiscus Ginger Cider (6.8% $7.25 pint), definitely a must try if you love cider! I ordered the turkey burger with truffle fries. The turkey burger was seasoned very well, nice and juicy! Unfortunately, everyone at the table food was cold or Luke warm. My sister and I had cold fries and We sent them back and got more cold fries, the last time they were finally hot. The hot tea had to be sent back because that wasn't hot either. Two burgers were wrong and the manger came to correct it, it took some time to remake and one NEVER received their side of sweet potato fries despite the 2nd manager retaking the order. Jimmy, the 2nd manager took off a turkey burger from the hill.

Their cheese curd is really good too- they look like little potato tots! So cute and so tasty. We got the jambalaya with pasta and - o m g it was so good- perfect amount and perfect spice! My friend got the ahi tuna sandwich and he said it was cooked really well. Also they have so many- too many drink options.

"Such a good place to bring groups of friends. Good happy hour deals during the week. I ordered the tacos that came with a side of rice and beans. The rice had too much garlic for my liking.

We met 3 of them in one night (we were there for 2 hours) We were interrupted multiple times about the switch and then 2 waiters checked up on us one after another.

"The food here is always delicious, HOWEVER, be aware of the terrible service. I have been to this location twice now, both times the restaurant was not at all busy, but both times the service was unfriendly and slow. Today we were greeted by a hostess who did not make eye contact once, barley spoke, and acted as though we were imposing on her day by showing up. We were seated right away but then waited for over 10 minutes at our table to be acknowledged by our server. When she finally came, she said she would be right back but then disappeared for another long period of time. When she finally came to take our order, she also acted annoyed as if we were bothering her by being there. She was extremely unfriendly and despite how long it took her to come to us, she suddenly made us feel extremely rushed when speaking through our orders. After we ordered it still took a very long time just for her to bring us water. The food was really good, but then when we were finished the server abruptly snatched (literally snatched) our plates away and said, ""so you're done then?"" We noticed while sitting there that nearly every staff member in the restaurant looked mad or upset walking around, almost like a morale problem. It was a very disappointing and strange experience. I love Yard House but I'll avoid this location at all costs from now on and advise my friends and family to do the same.",2.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"** 4.5 stars ** A sports bar in a mall?  I was skeptical at this recommendation, coming from a friend who isn't the beer aficionado I am, and never made the trip up from the city to try it.  Then the stars aligned as I happened to be in the area and needed lunch. Yard House is a chain of upscale sports bars, most located in shopping malls.  The Ridge Hill branch is located at one end of the mall, on the ground level.  It has an enormous, cavernous space.  Think of a typical urban sports bar then imagine it 10 times larger.  There's outdoor seating, plenty of booth and table seating, and seats that circle the huge bar that sits like an island in the center, where you'll find their 100+ draft beer taps. It's a feat to have a draft beer selection that includes plenty of mainstream beers worldwide (many listed in the aptly named ""Light and Easy"" category), a very respectable list of good domestic crafts and some international, and then some rotating limited ones.  Not to mention they have a few house brews, made for them by Uinta in Utah (white, honey blond, and IPA) and even a tripel from Silly in Belgium.  There's a smaller bottled list too, but with a draft list like this, one shouldn't need to go there. The food is similarly inclusive, a wide ranging menu of typical finger foods, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and entrees including fish and chips, pastas, steak, and fried chicken, many with twists.  Notably, there is a small gluten free menu and vegetarian dishes are marked.  Their lamb burger was cooked to order and very tasty, with a nice brioche bun. Inclusivity has never been better than at Yard House.  Amazingly, they really are a great sports bar, with huge flat screens everywhere, in a bright, open, clean, and handsome space.  There's truly a beer or more for any beer drinker, even the more discerning.  There's something to eat for everyone too.  When I'm in the area, I'll gladly make a stop at Yard House again.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"We've visited this place at least four times in the past two years. The first two times my hubby and I enjoyed our meals and the staff. He got the orange chicken Asian meal and I ordered this dance Mac n cheese. The third time I went I decided to try a burger but was disappointed. We went again last night in hopes that we would have better food this time but we were utterly disappointed. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri that came back looking like they used frozen mix from the freezer at the local supermarket. I told them I didn't like it and asked to take it back. I could taste the artificial coloring. Then the waiter said they're blender isn't working and that he should have told me before giving it to me. We ordered truffle fries that we usually always ordered as an appetizer. It looked like it was a kiddie meal with less than 20 fries in a kid sized glass bowl. We were shocked at the small size and disappointed. So then my husband's Asian bowl came back looking like it was thrown together. The veggies were super huge and overbearing. He didn't finish it. My orange chicken meal was tasty but the presentation of my daiquiri and my husband's meal really sucked and killed our vibe. The real reason why we went was because my husband received a birthday text from Yard house with a free dessert. The only highlight of our night was the apple and peach crusted pie with ice cream was the bomb! If I ever return back, I will only get this dessert!

"I used to come to Yard House a lot when they first opened, but then I grew tired of it and took a holiday from the restaurant for a while. While it's not my go-to place, it's geographically in a central spot for my colleagues and I to meet after work for drinks and apps. Yard House is large - an impressive bar with a boatload of beer on tap sits in the center which provides a nice focal point. My favorite part of the atmosphere is the music - it's all mainstream stuff but they have a nice variety of 70s to present which makes it more interesting than your average chain's offering. The menu has a lot of stuff, but I usually come here for drinks and small plates so we stick with apps. Most of their food is good; it's chain food but it's tasty. I don't drink beer much but their cocktails are pretty good, no real complaints (though I'm a light social drinker you can't really go by me). One thing I found weird at Yard House (and this has happened more than once) is that my server will sometimes change mid meal - either my original server ended their shift or was going on a break. I can understand that, but it's still a little strange to me.

Portion sizes are huge. They have tons of beer options for you beer lovers. The drinks here are Solid, they have a large selection. There are quite a few TVs here if you wanna sit at the bar and catch some of the games. For me the only real drawback there isn't music here.

Me & my husband just walked in for lunch while shopping at Ridge hill mall. 1st impression wow this place is super huge . Love how spacious it was with nice booth options to sit down. It was packed for lunch but that didn't affected the service at all. Our server was amazing he was attentive & perfect service. There drinks menu is humongous that I felt overwhelmed so my husband just randomly ordered some cocktail ( happy hour) for me & it was delicious. He got there local brewed beer. In food I ordered Chicken tortilla soup for me & my husband got there most popular burger. With my soup I asked for Truffle fries but my fries tasted salty & I didn't felt the taste of truffle at all. Overall this place is really good for game nights ( as there are TV with sports channel every where ) or family dinner or just regular place to eat & drink.,4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"I had lunch here yesterday and it was awful.  Let me just say... the restaurant was NOT busy. The service was terrible.  The waiter was leaning on our table- forearms down- and he continuously called me ""bro""- which drives me crazy!  I am NOT your bro. The cocktails took far too long to arrive at the table after ordering them. We saw the waiter leaning on the bar and chatting it up with the bartender while our cocktails sat there. We had to ask for water (we ordered an appetizer to share that was spicy), which also took forever.   The boneless chicken wings had a chemical like taste to them.  I love spicy food but these were not very good. When the rest of the food arrived, one of the items was incorrect- something we didn't even order.  I get it- it happens.  Someone quickly brought over the right item. The waiter stopped by two more times, only to ask if we needed another cocktail.  Never once asked how the food was.  I was so hungry but honestly couldn't finish anything we ordered.  The food was typical of a commercialized restaurant, similar to Friday's or Applebee's.  Haven't been to either of those places in years, and certainly won't be back to Yard House anytime soon.",1.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"This was a lame excuse for a dinner. I placed an order for shrimp vodka pasta, and after 30 minutes of waiting for the food they brought me out a Mac n cheese that I did not order. They proceeded to correct my order, while getting the other 5 people in my parties orders correct. After waiting another 25 minutes for my right meal to come out they messed up my order AGAIN. By this point an hour has passed and everyone else had eaten I had no choice but to ask for the food to go. Another gentleman came to tell me they were correcting my order and that my ""chicken penne"" would be coming out shortly. I NEVER ordered a chicken penne. This was the 3rd time they mixed up my order. By this point I was infuriated and told them to bring me my food to go. When the manager came out, they apologized and gave me my order for free. This is not my first time having a problem at a yard house location. I will NEVER come to this location or any yardhouse location for that matter ever again. Such a poorly ran place.

I came here on a date with my boyfriend for date night on a Wednesday evening. We were quickly seated which was a plus because we were both hungry. There is a lot of variety in the menu which is concerning because it makes me wonder if all the dishes are going to be good. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken which came with nice crispy chicken and good sized sweet potato pancakes. I guess I was a little crazy to expect the place to offer or at least have syrup in stock though they had a meal with pancakes. That made me a little sad and took away from my expectation but the pancakes were good nonetheless. My boyfriend was very disappointed with his meal. He ordered carnitas tacos which were bland. It did not appear to be seasoned at all. Just like they threw meat in the tacos and called it a day. Our waiter was kinda awkward. He seemed to just disappear and reappear in the darkness. Our glasses were very dirty like finger prints all over type dirty and with juice all over them. I'm hoping he just carelessly let the dispenser overflow. However it would have been nice if he took the extra step of wiping the glass down. Overall things were okay not sure if we'll come back. It seems like we would have been happier had we just wanted appetizers and drinks. We will leave the taco making to the pros and don't suggest you try them here.,3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"So, the first time I was at Yard House, I loved it. I loved the atmosphere and the several different types of beer they had to offer. I had the jambalaya pasta (delicious) the first time. The second time, however, I ordered the cajun pasta and it upset my stomach HORRIBLY. I basically was incapacitated the next day. The person I was with also had a bad reaction to his food (personal pizza) and was worse off than I was. So... it's safe to say that we won't be returning to Yard House. Stomach issues aside, the service definitely leaves a lot to be desired. There were times when we couldn't find our server at all and had to request things from any server we could get our hands on.

Lots of creative uses of the Gardein mock meat meant we had a number of good choices for dinner. And of course more beer choices than you'll ever need. Important for vegans that there are not a lot of vegan options; there is a lot of bread and cheese in their vegetarian collection. And they have this disclaimer on their menu, ""While items marked ""Vegetarian"" are made without meat or stock from an animal, yard house uses communal cooking equipment and prep areas for all of our menu offerings."" We ate at the bar, and I was impressed with how comfortable it was, and the good service we got. I was impressed that they include calorie counts on their menu, and offer a number of lower calorie options.

I don't care who you are, that was a pizza with a slice of tomato on it! Where is my goddamn tomato sauce? The fried calamari wasn't up to standard either. You had a little ingredients missing, mostly seasoning. It made me think long and hard about that squid's life; that his death wasn't honored by making him palatable. That night, my friend's burger also came out burnt and before giving him his beer, they neglected to tell him IPAs weren't served in halfyards despite him ordering it.

"I love yardhouse.....in Orlando and give it 5 stars, hands down. But this location (been here twice) isn't as amazing so I had to give it 3 stars. The service isn't exciting and the decor is more barlike in ny (it feels like a nice, big restaurant in orlando). Then again, you can always expect smaller and darker in ny :) So down to the food. I've had many, many items on the menu so I'll just point out a few must haves, good and skip items. Must Haves: -lobsters garlic noodles: ALWAYS amazing and even if you can't order this, I get an order to go. It's THAT good plus it's really difficult to recreate at home..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -Lamb burger : I'm not a huge meat fan, but this burger done medium is outrageous on flavor and the lamb is cleaned so well ...not very gamey. Burger to perfection - Moo Shu Egg rolls: my favorite appetizer! You can't watch calories when you order this, but it's AMAZING...creamy, yet spicy, I can never have enough. Two rolls come in halves (4 pieces) to an order. Everyone will want their own! -Salted butterscotch caramel pudding: EXTREMELY sweet and a must share with someone but my favorite dessert on the menu. Perfect for those that love creamy, salty and sweet (not everyone agrees with my opinion of this item) -Any of the tacos, so good -New Za'atar Salmon - best on flavor from all of the fish dishes Good Items: -Calamari -Shrimp bowl -Shrimp Jambalaya -Lettuce wraps -Crab cakes (most of my family loves, i'm not on the fence, but i'm not a crab cake fan) -Lobster mac n cheese Skip It - Deviled eggs (two eggs sliced in half) - nothing exciting here - Ginger crusted salmon -Sea Bass (I love sea bass and this was just boring) -Halilbut (I love halibut, this was also uneventful and lacked flavor) All and all, most items are good here but some are better than others if you are making a trip. As far as drinks go, there's something for everyone whether you love beer (i think there are 32 different beers on tap - very cool) or you like a great cocktail. The cocktails get 5 stars for creativity. If i hadn't gone to the one in Orlando, I would give this one 4 stars...but now that I have something to compare to I have to go a little lower.",3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"Terrible experience here. I would never give them my business again and would advice against this place to anyone I know. I went yesterday for dinner and it was very busy, but they had more than enough staff to handle it, so we stayed and figured it wouldn't be a long wait. Well the original 25 minutes estimate turned into 45 before they admitted that they had accidentally skipped over my party. I thought it was reasonable to expect that the next table would be ours, but I had to insist on it and the receptionists were very rude during the entire ordeal. Well my family and I finally got a table and thought we would have a nice dinner at that point, but we never got the chance. After placing our orders with one waiter, he informed us that a different employee would be waiting on us from that point. We thought that was fine, but apparently he went on break without putting our dinner orders in. We flagged the new waiter down after 30 minutes with no food and he seemed confused when we told him that we were waiting for our entrees (which leaves the separate question of why he didn't take our dinner orders after that long if he didn't think we already placed them). Sure enough, the manager comes over and tells us that after an hour and a half of sitting in his restaurant, our dinner orders did not get in. We were all fed up by that point and did not accept his offer for dinner on him. He was not sympathetic though, he seemed to be offended that we did not take him up on that and rudely stated ""I'm trying to make things right here"" as if he was the victim in this situation (he was probably desperate to keep me from writing this). I understand that the restaurant was very crowded, but surely they anticipated that kind of rush with the amount of staffers they had. Mixups and misplaces orders happen though, what has me writing this long review telling you avoid this place is that the staff made an already miserable experience 10 times worse with their consistently dismissive attitude and unapologetic dysfunction; from the waiters all the way up to management. It was my birthday yesterday and I chose this place for dinner with the family because I always enjoy going to the one in the Palisades.

The feta cream cheese really compliments the burger. The service was mediocre, we went long periods of time without seeing our waitress at all. The overall ambiance of the place was pretty cool.

"One of my favorite places, my lady and I had dinner here this past Sunday. As always, greeted immediately. The place was spotless and there was a nice buzz, with a nice bar crowd. We sat at our table and were greeted by our server within 30 seconds or so and we started on our menus. Lots of new items! My lady started with a Brazilian Lemonade, which she loved, and I just had a Dr Pepper. It was cool to see Dr Pepper, I know at other locations they served Pepsi products, interesting. For apps, we had the Ahi Poke Stack, on point! Also, the Duck Wings. Hadn't had the duck wings before. Not bad, a bit plain, but not bad. Entrees were the Maui Chicken and a steak Cobb Salad. Both dishes were perfectly executed. The chicken was cooked to perfection and not dry. The sauce was salty and delicious, and the veggies were crisp. The salad looked beautiful and I had a bite of the steak; delicious. Yard House's beef products are very very good for the money. Only a couple of minor things I noticed: condiments weren't dropped at our table before our food, and my Maui chicken was dropped with the plate upside down basically. Minor details but I only mention them because in Yard House typically nails all that stuff. Anyway, always a pleasure and will be back! It's a bit out of the way, but I go every chance I get.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"When we got there, we only had to wait bout 2 minutes to be seated.  Everyone was very kind, and provided service to us immediately.  I was waiting for the rest of my party, so we started off with apps and drinks.  My partner ordered a rum & gingerale with a double shot which was excellent.  I ordered the onion ring mountain and French onion soup as starters - they were both excellent.  The waiter seemed to be a little overwhelmed because of the amount of tables - but I didn't feel it too much.  I had to ask him to bring a pepsi twice.  For entree's, I had a seafood mix pasta - the only thing I did not like which I picked out were the shiitake mushrooms.  The bill was $122 for 4 people - I think it is a little overpriced for what they offer (they don't offer like a surf & turf or anything).  Overall, it was a good atmosphere - would I go again?  I don't know as of yet - would I recommend? Yes - try at least one time",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"What to expect when you dine at Yard House: average food basically interchangeable with Applebees, TGI Fridays, etc. and subpar service. On my most recent experience, for lunch, our server appeared disinterested in doing much of anything. Even though the restaurant had just opened and was maybe five tables above empty, he still managed to disappear for long periods of time. Eventually, he came by to say he was taking his lunch break (which would be roughly an hour after the restaurant opened) and another equally disinterested waiter came to take his place. I'm assuming that many of you who come here do so because the line for Cheesecake Factory is too long.

"I've eaten here a couple of times over the years since the place opened. Nothing to write home about. Typical casual dining chain restaurant. Mediocre (mass produced tasting) food *blech*. Menu is kind of all over the place with a little bit of everything, so no real direction or area of expertise. Even in terms of being a 'bar food' menu or a gastro-pub, I've had way better in mid price range. The second time we only came back here because a friend who is a BIG beer fan really wanted to check the place out on account of its beer selection on tap. Kind of cool. Staff is friendly, service is fine. Stopping by for a drink is OK. I wouldn't bother with the food again though.",2.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"I'm a Yard House frequent flyer so to speak, and thought I'd finally write a review.  I come here once a week during Happy Hour. YH has a terrific selection of around 130 beers on draught and a good happy hour menu. Sample selections are wings (several varieties--I'm a fan of the Firecracker) chicken lettuce wraps with 3 really good Asian dipping sauces, chicken nachos (probably the best deal on the HH menu, since they can easily feed 2 very hungry people), poke stack, burger sliders with fries, and my favorite, BBQ chicken pizza, and a couple dozen other items--all for $8 or under.  If you sit at the bar and come more than a couple of times, the bartenders will get to know you and what you like to order (they know I'm an Ithaca Flower Power IPA guy). There are a lot of other things on the menu, of course, a range of salads, 10 or more types of burgers, tacos, numerous sandwiches, mac n cheese, and a large selection of appetizers and main courses.  It ain't haute cuisine (and I'm too cheap for any of the entrees over $15), but the food is pretty good.  All in all, a good place, which is why I keep coming back.",5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

I don't know if it's the sauce, the meat, the combo but I was super impressed specially for someone that's not a big fan of cheeseburgers and the like. We've also had the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps, the calamari, and the pizza among many other tasty dishes. Everything has always been good but if I crave a good, juicy cheeseburger, this is the place. Also their choices of beer is pretty expansive, never seen anything like it, and my husband loves that.

"Terrible experience recently at the Yard house. I'm not sure exactly what happened because i had eaten at yard house a few times in the past and didn't have a bad experience. Firstly i called at 3pm to try to see if I could get a reservation at 6pm to avoid any wait times since my family was visiting from overseas and I'm sure had jet lag. Was told they don't take reservations after 1pm but to still call back at 5pm to see if there is a table they can hold. Ok, no problem!  I call back at 5pm, I'm told to call back at 5:30pm instead. Ok..i call back in half an hour, am put on hold and then finally get my name taken with my party number and that it shouldn't be a problem. This should been a red flag for me but I'm so tired myself from travelling, I figure it will be fine once we get there. My boyfriend and I arrive on time, but my party is about 10 minutes late, and we are told it will be a 25-35 minute wait even though they did have my name down from my recent call just half an hour ago. Again,  I should have just saw the red flag and left but at this point, but my sis said we should just wait. Big mistake because it takes almost an hour to sit us, and then another hour to bring us out our food - What particularly makes me mad is that the hostess/front desk person kept insisting they were ""clearing our table"" and ""getting it ready now ""when clearly it was not the case. Finally when we sit down, completely scattered service - my food is luke warm and the cheese on my vampire taco is chewy from likely sitting out too long; the taco also upsets my boyfriend's stomach. my cousin doesn't get sweetener for her tea after she asked about an hour ago. The clincher was getting the wrong bill sent to me from a table that already signed it, and them almost forgetting to give my credit card back. I was so tired at that point, I almost forgot my credit card too and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I'm so disappointed because I hadn't seen my relatives in so long, and just wanted to have a nice meal with them. The only positives I can say was that at least the waitress brought us ice cream when I told her my cousins were visiting from overseas (although the ice cream plate said ""congrats"" for some reason - I hope we didn't get someone else's celebration ice cream instead)  and that she also remembered to bring my card before I left, and apologized. Other than that, super disappointing and not worth the wait and disorganized service for mediocre food. I'm sad to see yard house drop off like this, because I do remember it being good at  one point. Honestly if she had just said they don't take any reservations after 1pm and left it at that, i know I would have tried to find another place that did. They shouldnt string people along with the wait times. Never will come back here again that's for sure.",1.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

They have a wide variety of beers, which is probably why they are called ""Yard House"". The wait staff was very friendly as were the hostesses at the front. There was a bit of a wait for us, about 30 mins but that was probably due to the fact that it was the beginning of happy hour when we arrived. Happy hour here is great because a lot of the appetizers are cheaper during happy hour times, which was a nice surprise for us.

I went to Yardhouse today. Everything there is pretty consistent but service. They never offer me water in the over 15 times I have been there and my Cherry Limeade (Alcoholic Beverage) was changed to be served in a smaller glass :(. Other than that I tried the Smores Brownie. It's super good- should have taken a photo. You need to order it 15 minutes in advance because it's fresh. They have amazing brownies and the BEST happy hour bar and food menu. Love it here. So if you want a Brownie please order in advance. It's big enough for 3 people. Some of your drinks may be the same price but in a smaller glass and service is consistent.

"Ill give it 3.5 stars. My friend and i decided to eat here after having lots of fun at the indoor skydiving place nearby, iFly. When we arrived it was early, so we didnt have to wait, we were seated right away. About half an hour later though, you could see a line forming outside; i guess it a popular place on the weekends. The decor was nothing fascinating; it was the equivalent of any Dallas BBQ or TGI Fridays. But as a construction worker, i could definately appreciate the pipe work and other craftsmanship hidden in the black painted ceiling. Anyway, we were given the option of sitting in a comfortable booth or the higher tables. Once we received the menu, the options seemed like they would never end. To start off, our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. We asked her what she recommended. She suggested the passion fruit ice tea. I was excited because i love passion fruit. Unfortunately this ice tea has got to be one of the worst ive ever had; not only did it taste nothing like passion fruit, but it was also one of those natural ice teas that arent sweet at all. Thats when it started making sense why she brought over all the packages of sugar. As an appetizer, my friend ordered the Spinach Cheese Dip. I didnt try it, but it was a huge plate of flat bread with a well portioned bowl of the dip. She wasnt able to finish it. For myself, i ordered the Moo Shu Egg Rolls. This isnt a chinese restaurant, so i was somewhat skeptical about how the egg rolls would taste. They were actually surprisingly good. Inside they had a bunch of chicken an a mixture of vegetable; they were just fine without any sauce. I let my friend try a bit, she liked them as well. They were too good to leave any on the plate. For entrees, my friend ordered the Penne with Chicken. Once again, it came in a well portioned plate. It was also full of chicken and had just the right amount of sauce all over it. I tried a bit myself. I cant complain, but it wasnt anything out of this world; still impressive for a non-italian restaurant. I ordered the St.Louis Style Bbq Ribs with a side of Truffle Fries. There were 2 sizes available for the ribs; of course i had to tell her to give me the ""MAN"" size. I had no idea how big the ribs would turn out to be; i couldnt finish them. The taste wasnt bad, but not much difference between these ribs and something out of Applebees. The fries were plentiful and thin, crispy, and tasty; not saying that i would put any sauce on truffle fries, but just saying that no ketchup or bbq sauce was necessary. Finally for dessert, my friend kept it simple and ordered the Chocolate Souffle Cake. It was so tiny, and most of it was the ice cream scoop on top. I was tempted to try some, but i was afraid of leaving her with nothing. For myself, the option that stood out on the dessert menu was some sort of Strawberry Banana Bread Pudding. After eating all those egg rolls and ribs, the plate my dessert came in seemed enormous. Once i tried it, i could definately savor the mixture of banana and strawberry. Unfortunately, i cant say i enjoyed it. Honestly it wasnt bad at all, but i think that the strawberries used to prepare it were more sour than sweet. I didnt bother to finish it. Overall, the place was huge, the plates were inexpensive, and the noise level was minimal. The quality of the food definately was nothing 5 star, but if youre in the area, this wouldnt be a bad place to stop and grab a bite. I definately have nothing negative to say about the service; shoutout to our waitress Sollo.

"Long story, short - great sports bar with tons of space, great beer choices and happy hour menus, affordable prices, great staff BUT call in beforehand if you have a big party so they can better prepare for you! Enjoy! Great sports bar with a selection of beer on tap! And I love me some beer on tap! I'll get the cons out of the way... 1. This is place is way too far from me but that's out of their control aha. 2.  We ordered some beer samples but rang it up as half-yard beer portions. We ended up taking it because most of my friends and I have worked in the food industry and understood that he made a simple mistake and didn't want him to get in trouble for it.

"I have been to this specific Yard house about a couple of times but have never gotten to reviewing it. Okay, so the food is good. Very busy restaurant however especially if you go during peak hours. Easily a 35-45 Minute wait. The restaurant is pretty dim, but pretty clean. An issue that i do have and i have noticed several times I've been there, so it wasn't a one time isolated event, is that the floors are pretty slippery towards the bar area, I mean does someone hear Lawsuit? Anyways, there's an extensive selection of draft beers, wines, and cocktails, which will pretty much suit anyone's taste,and at a decent price. The highlight of this restaurant which is my main reason why i go is.........the ONION RINGS!!. Amazing, Fantastic, Delicious. Life. The ""Onion Ring Tower"" has stacked up crispy delicious onion rings with two sauces on the side. The Chipotle ranch sauce (i think?) is delicious with the rings. Highly Recommend you try them for Appetizers, you wont regret it. The Burgers are pretty decent too. I'd recommend the New York Steak Sandwich which was actually really good- probably the best thing I've tried there. It comes with swiss cheese, fried onions, tomatoes, garlic aïoli, on a brioche. Service is good, but honestly it varies. I mean the waiters are very attentive and friendly, but sometimes the food takes FOREVER to come. Not always but sometimes, and I've been there a couple of times, so i know. But Overall, I'd recommend coming here off peak hours or come anytime for the onion rings!.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"Where to start...  After having a BAD experience at the Yardhouse in the Palisades Center and stating as such in my review, Justin from guest services contacted me and after some back and forth emails, convinced me to give them an opportunity to make things right.  However, after hearing good things from fellow co-workers at my restaurant about the Yardhouse @ Ridge Hill in Yonkers I decided to come here with my fiancè. So here we go.... After a small situation with our seating and me quickly explaining to the 3 servers/hostesses my situation, a server by the name of Tara was quick to accommodate and provide us with outstanding service for the rest of our time there. On to the food and drinks... Drinks were delicious.  My fiancè had a mango mojito which was refreshing and perfectly made.  I had the strawberry beer which was also very good. Apps... My fiancè had the coconut shrimp which Tara recommended.  Shrimp was tender and accompanying sauces were good. I had a Korean bbq short rib taco which was delicious. I also ordered the kung pao calamari which while at Yardhouse in the palisades was rubbery and tough,  while here it was tender and flavors were good, to my disappointment the calamari came out room temperature to cold.  After expressing my disappointment, the MOD, came out to address my concern and quickly comped me some of the delicious Korean bbq tacos. For our entrees, my fiancè ordered the chicken rice bowl which she says was very good and hot (temperature wise).  I ordered the black truffle burger(MR) with truffle fries.  This burger was delicious!  Seasoned perfectly, cooked to the right temp and the housemade truffle cheese and bacon onion jam where a perfect accompaniment to the burger.  And who doesn't like truffle fries...lol All in all, a much better experience than my last at the Palisades Center. A big thanks to Justin in guest services for his kindness in addressing my concerns.  Most importantly, a HUGE thanks to our server Tara for her professionalism, friendly disposition and kindness and making our experience that much better.  She is someone I hope to see in a customer service management position @ Yardhouse.",5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"This place was awesome. I hope one opens near me soon! I came here with my mom and brother for dinner. This location is really great,  right in the middle of a bunch of other restaurants and shops. Upon walking in, it wasn't too crowded for a Saturday evening and we were seated right away. My mom ordered a Bloody Mary which came with a shot of beer. Never seen that, but I was very intrigued. I ordered the wings (a must whenever I go back to NY) and they were pretty good. All of our food came out quickly and we enjoyed everything we ordered.

"Okay this is the 2nd time I'm trying this chain.  It was a better experience food wise not so much service wise. (The first time I ate at the yard house it was at the palisades mall. This is my first time at this location.) We were a large group. 7 adults & 1 baby. We had a short wait 10 min tops and were seated by 5:45pm. Our server came over right away and took our drink orders and the baby's dinner order then gave us time to look over the menu. I ordered her the Mac n Cheese with fruit on the side. (I wish I had asked for the fruit to come out as a dessert or her bc once they brought the food and fruit sure didn't want the Mac n Cheese... She wanted just the fruit.... Irritating.) I shared an appetizer with my grandpa of the Fried Calamari (delicious BUT heads up to anyone who doesn't like spicy food... this was pretty spicy.) Others shared the Nachos (which I tried and liked.) My meal was the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger with Sweet Potato Fries... also delicious. Everyone else that was with me enjoyed their meals as well.... The service however lacked when it came time for desserts. My G'pa ordered a decaf coffee and the cheesecake (he placed his order while the rest of us were still eating, I planned on ordering dessert but since he was done before the rest of us he wanted his dessert asap.) His coffee came out right away. Then he waited. And waited. **sipping his last drip of coffee** The coffee was gone before the cheesecake even came to the table... at least 20 minutes passed before his cheesecake was brought out. He asked for another cup of coffee, and the assistant waiter gave him some more. Now, I was the only one that wanted dessert (besides g'pa who was now done with this dessert) SO, by time I flagged down our waiter it was at least 10+ min after our entire table was cleared off. I ordered the Salted Caramel Butterscotch Pudding. (I've had this one other time so I know how good it is). Wouldn't you know, 20-25 minutes later out comes my dessert. It was just as delicious as I remember but the wait for it was just unacceptable.  I'm pretty sure there isn't a pastry chef back there whipping up the desserts... so why did they take so long to come out?! Anyways... Other than the slow service, my opinion on the food has gotten better. I will definitely be back with hopes that they put a fire under their butt in the kitchen!",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

Kudos to management for hiring the right people! As for the food, I had the Lobster spinach artichoke, sooo good! Just wish it brought a bit more, we had so many chips and not that much dip. I think it'd be helpful if they added salsa on the side. My friend had the chicken nachos, those were pretty good. We also ordered sliders and Hawaiian pizza, all very good, but cold, I didn't finish it. I probably should've told the waitress but I didn't want to stress it. The Hawaiian pizza was good but very soggy, they might have had it standing to long on the plate maybe? For dessert we has the graham cracker brownie and ordered ice cream on the side, sooo good, if you're a chocolate lover you'll like it!

We asked the server to ask the bar tender to perhaps add little more tequila.  She replied it was pre-measured and we would be charged extra to make the drink a little stronger.  We declined.  The 2nd one, without asking was much better. So what gives? We ordered a pasta dish and a full rack of ribs. The pasta was served and we had to look for the server for parmigiano cheese. It took over 10 mins.  By then pasta was cold.  We then had to ask the server for additional wet napkins since I was served a full rack without any indentations on where to slice each rib. She indicated we had 1 on the table.  I reminded her there was a full rack ordered. We received 1 more.  I have ordered ribs at many locations, almost automatically they provided extra wet napkins.  Plus we did not get a small plate to place the bones.  I had to place the various bones on a corner of the plate.

Everything was fine until they sat us down. The server asked us if we wanted tomatoes and cheese on our guac. We said on the side and they bring it out on top. My drink took 15 minutes after apps came. She asked me if I wanted a half or full turkey salad. I said half she brings a full chicken salad. The temperature outside dropped fast out of nowhere so we asked to be moved inside. Supposedly she kept checking and the same two booths remained empty on other side of glass window the entire time. She never told us if there was anything avaible inside. Meanwhile we had a 9yr old freezing. Restaurant wasnt even busy. We never got moved inside. My girlfriend asked for hot sauce and she never brought it out. Her daughter asked for rice krispys treat for desert. They brought out a sundae. We were in deep convo trying not too let the horrible service ruin the end of our long workday. The worst service ever and I am not one to look for things to complain about. Im simple Im easy and as I type this review I swear my throat is swelling up probably from a dirty glass. I feel reason for this service is because we didnt rack up the bill due to my girlfriend and daughter only having one appetizer ans 2 meals plus mine and one drink. I guess she noticed we werent racking up bill with drinks for her to make higher tip so she gave us the worst. Never again will I return.

No ""I'll check with the chef, but I don't think so"" or ""Sorry, we don't have that,"" which would have been understandable. The order was messy. One of our dining companions had to ask the man who brought the food to heat up the sweet potato fries, which were served tepid. When she asked if we were enjoying the meal, I told her the truth. ""I'm afraid not."" ""You don't like it?"" ""No, the fried cheese curds are not seasoned and the horseradish aioli is bland."" Blank stare followed by walking away. When she came back, she didn't make eye contact with me and just acknowledged my dining companions. As we wrapped up, she did talk to me again to ask if I'd like my uneaten dish ""boxed up.""

"I've started eating here more since I come to Ridge Hill often, and honestly the establishment looks really high class, but their prices are more modest than I thought. Not if you're getting steak or lobster of course, but there's this interesting dish that I got the first time I came here called a California Roll. I expected sushi because it has the same name, but this place takes that idea and turns it into something new and delicious. Firstly it comes in the shape of a fried rice bowl, so the form of ""sushi"" is off the table immediately, but it's packed with what seems to be the ingredients for sushi, excluding the nori, and it even has jalapeños in it, which gives it a nice kick. If you don't like spicy food, I recommend something else, but anything you get there will be just as good. The burgers and fries are amazing, the nacho platter is large enough to feed multiple people and is packed with so many flavors, and even after, the desserts are the perfect way to finish a meal. The brownie dish with marshmallows is perfection, but when I came with a friend I got a tiny soufflé dessert that we shared and it was just as good. I can't drink yet, but there are over a hundred different types of draft beers there as well, and I'm pretty sure it's the pride and joy of that restaurant. It's smack center in the middle and it's large, with a bar wrapping around it. There's always a good amount of bartenders , and one day when I came by myself and I didn't want to take up a whole table, I just sat at the bar, and the bartender gave amazing customer service. He came around every few minutes or so, asking how I was doing. I was waiting for someone so I babysat my cranberry juice but he was very attentive. A really nice place to bring a party of people. It's dark in there though, and it gets especially packed at night and during the weekends, so the wait for tables can get pretty lengthy. It's worth the wait though, and as the most popular restaurant at Ridge Hill, you won't be disappointed. Also, there are happy hour times which give good prices and $5 draft beers. I usually use that opportunity to just  get my $8 California roll though. Really nice place. The waiters are friendly too.",5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"The Yard House is a beer lover's with over 100 ales, craft beers, IPA and lagers AND a foodies dream too.

To test this theory, one would have to travel to The Palisades Mall in Nyack, NY as its the sole venue that would afford you the opportunity to compare the two establishments. However, the YH rules supreme to sports enthusiast as majority of their flat screens are tuned to a sports channel with maybe one on CNN.

However, with Yard House no matter how many times we go, it is still always so good! What I love about this place is one of two the beer - while the bottles and cans are usually the same, the taps rotate. The second thing is the amount of vegetarian/vegan things on the menu! I'm usually not a fan of faux meat, unless it's really done right - sometimes the texture/smell is a little freaky. Yard House uses Gardein which is the same brand they sell in Target surprisingly. My suggestions: -The buffalo wings and the jerk wings are on point. -The lettuce wraps with mushrooms and tofu are great if you want to eat on the lighter side. -The truffle fries are really addictive. -If you're not a beer drinker, try the raspberry lambic. -The Thai chicken noodle salad was delicious! -This location gets REALLY busy, really quickly and the wait can go up to an hour and a half so I would avoid 7-9 pm.",5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

Come here with friends, order half a yard, drink it all up and then get another half yard.  I would recommend against ordering a full yard unless you're married to one particular brand of beer and don't want to experiment.

I wish I remembered our waitress' name so I could shout her out -_-, but service was very helpful and pleasant. *BEER!!* A spot with over 150 beer choices and a waitress who knows her stuff? What more could you ask for? They offer free tasters (2 per person), which is great with so many different options. Of  the beers I tasted from their Chalkboard series (rotating keg selection), the ""Oscar The Grouch"" was by far my favorite; nice smoky flavor. I ended up ordering a Framboise Beer Float (I couldn't resist) and it was absolutely delicious! You can also get the float with a Stout, which I think would've been good also if you like stouts. My friend got Purple Haze; a nice alternative for you Blue Moon lovers. When ordering a beer; go big with a signature ""Half-Yard""...why not. *Food* We ordered from the late night specials menu; cheap prices for your favorite late night cravings. The truffle burger was amazing! Loved the truffle cheese, and that magical tomato-bacon-onion jelly..mmmm. Sweet potato fries were also good. I didn't try my friends garlic fries but they smelled delicious. Officially a Yardie.",5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
The food is delicious.  It is similar to Cheesecake Factory in terms of quality.  The service is bad.  They have a number of waiters but most of them just chat amongst themselves at the back.,3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
Absolutely delicious this is my second time here. The first time was with a group of co-workers and I was not paying attention to my food. However this time around I am not disappointed with my choice of tacos with rice and beans. I had a carnitas and an asada taco. They did have a bit of a kick to them the meal was not overwhelming. #amazinglydelicious. Highly recommend.,5.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"Not impressed with the service. During my last visit, I ordered a beer, and it took a while for the waitress to tell me that they no longer had it on tap. No big deal. So I ordered another one, and waited a solid half hour for it to arrive. My girlfriend and I finished our appetizer, and were well into our meal before I saw our waitress again. We were just about done with dinner when my drink arrived. Mind you, I didn't have water or anything else. She offered dessert, but it wasn't clear if that was on the house or not. We were charged full price for our food and drinks. I'm a fan of the food and drink selection, but with so many other solid options in the area, I won't be in a rush to return.",2.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"I gave this place a 4 star because of the AMAZING SERVICE! Liz was our waitress , I am definitely coming back for her, being that it was my first time, she took her time to explain to me the variety of the food and drinks. The food sucked, I would give the food Zero stars, it has nothing interesting, it was  the usual beer fast food place, extremely high on calories and pricey than the usual, But the ONLY thing that would bring me back was the amazing service and care  we received by our waitress LIZ, ASK for her to take care of you and you'll have a totally different experience!!",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
I visited Yard House for the first time as I was celebrating my friend's birthday. The drinks were very refreshing. The Kobe beef over Jasmine rice as an appetizer was exquisite. Initially I ordered ribs but the appetizer was really filling. I told my waiter and he was accommodating in updating my order to a small order of Jambalaya instead. The decor is very inviting and the dishes are plated nicely.,4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
Unless you are coming here for 1/2 priced apps...I would skip this place. My service is always below average and the food is very mediocre.

"Folks, this is a chain, let's not be coy about this, but one hell of a chain. Think Cheesecake factory and Pub love child. Good food, good drinks. I always take advantage of the happy hour. Half priced apps. Dimly lit, intimate yet sports bari-ish. A little oxymoronic, I know, but hey, it's Yard House. Yes, there will be occasional hiccups with service and orders, but what restaurant is fully immune to this? You don't watch a popcorn flick expecting to have your life changed. You don't go to a chain and expect a Chef to come out and hand feed you the finest handpicked grapes imported from the most extravagant of vines.

I give it the same rating but it's because there staff tries so hard to please you it's amazing . If other business in America had this kind of treatment this would be a better place . I had the ribs this time and I thought they were good 4/5 . The sauce is good and they also give you a spicy BBQ sauce that is delicious . The creamed corn wasn't that good but the black bean mixture that was served was delicious . The onion ring tower wasn't as good as it look in the photos . The rings came sort of dry and small but the batter was ok I must say . The chipotle sauce was good and the ranch was good but I ended up using ketchup because I'm so used to other locations rings and sauces that this just didn't compare ( red robbin ) My girlfriend ordered the orange chicken and if she can give it a 0/5 she would . She didn't like anything about it and I tried it and I didn't ether . I don't think I would try this place again there menu is a lot different from other restaurants I've been to and has many options .,3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"5* for the service.  Will definetly be back for quality service all the way around starting with the server.  The beer selection is excellent as it is loaded with tons of interesting domestics while also balanced great classic beers from around the world.   Really well done. The space is comfortable and spacious, feels very clean as well. Great place to watch a game with the huge bar. The food though is honestly a little weak even for bar food.  Boneless jerk wings were a mistake-- pretty dry and tasteless.  French Onion soup had a great taste but came out lukewarm.  Lettuce wraps were delicious, too many sauces though. I wish they simplified the menu a bit, but overall yard house yonkers is one of the more pleasant service experiences in recent memory.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"First of all, this is my first Yelp post as I usually don't rate restaurants but I felt I HAD to with my experience yesterday.  I am a regular at this Yardhouse location and usually love it here.  Truffle fries being a fave among many other things.  A colleague and I came in and sat at the bar for lunch.  There were roughly 4-5 other customers there.  We got there about 120P.  Melissa the bartender did not even acknowledge us until 130P and I know this because our receipt was time stamped.  She took our order and proceeded to go about her work.  We ordered soup, crab dip, maui chicken and fries.  She did not bring us our food for 35 minutes.  I watched my soup sit on the warming shelf for quite some time.  This is during a quiet lunch hour and the restaurant was not even 1/3rd full.  The food was mediocre at best, maybe since it had been sitting under the lamps I don't know.  The service was clearly awful.  Also off topic, $3.25 for a soda?  Really Yardhouse?  That is ridiculous. The cost of soda is ridiculously cheap and for you to mark it up over 300% is not right.  For a couple more bucks, I could have gotten a beer!  Not sure if and when I will ever be back.",2.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"Love it here, great variety of food and beers available. The variety alone would be awesome enough to get them a 5 star review, but I have just two gripes: 1) It can get packed, and service can sometimes (and understandably) be slow, which is a sign that they're a great place to eat, but Saturday's I like to be able to not have to wait an hour to get a table. 2) Why do they have to follow that same annoying light concept... Dim lights just plain suck, can't I just SEE my food, pretty please? Fake candlelight is not a solution... I don't know who thought up that idea, just turn on the lights! If not for those two issues, it would garner a 5 star rating, but those issues are big ones for me, so I can't honestly give them the 5. Sorry, I really do love your restaurant though, and plan to keep going back again and again.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"Ok so I have to say that I always wondered about this place. Every time I came out to Ridge hill it was so dark that you couldn't see anything from outside. We were seated quickly and the hostess was awesome. Our waitress was also great she came to check in on us and gave us enough time to choose from their huge menu. This is how our food looked. Starters: Fried Calamari- I loved it!! I am a calamari fan and we usually order calamari wherever we go (NOT HEALTHY I KNOW). Chicken tortilla soup for those of you who know me know I hate soup but this was creamy and spicy and the chicken tender and oh man, they made me like this soup ughhh. Entrees: Hubby- Ahi tuna pan seared salad.. Now I must tell you that I am NOT a raw seafood fan but DAMNNN.... The Ahi was amazing. Seared to perfection and the flavors were out of this world.. Daughter-- Angus burger.. Lets just say we didn't hear a word from her and when we looked at her she looked like a hamster with cheeks full of nuts. My Dish-- I had the surf and turf burger. It was a burger with Lobster and asparagus with a great sauce on the side. Now from how the waitress explained it was not what I was expecting but nonetheless the flavors made up for the visual. It was moist and THICK and the lobster was just falling off the burger and the asparagus added the right amount of crunch. Over all the food was amazing. Now I went to the restroom with my daughter and wow I was amazed that it was actually clean lol. I mean c'mon public bathrooms are nasty but this was actually refreshing lol (we still didn't sit but that's besides the point). The only thing I would change would be bringing my daughter next time.

I always recommend their Chicken Nacho during Happy Hour .. you get way more for your money during happy hour. The waiters are always terrific however the hostesses at the from are not friendly and always seem like they do not want to be there.

So I had to subtract a star ..,4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House
"This was nice option while in Yonkers for  quick family trip.  While it is family friendly, it would be a fun option with a few couple to watch a game and get appitizers/small dishes. The drinks were very good.  The service was acceptable.  The food was prepared as ordered. They have a lot of fancy sounding items on the menu.  We were there with friends and four kids (all under 8 yrs old) so we were not there for a long dining experience.  Burgers were tasty.  Served on a fancy brouche bun. My only complaint is that our service was a little slow.  He was very friendly and helpful, but when we were ready to leave we had to practically hunt him down. If you are eating here with the family, be warned that at some point the lights dim and the music seemed to get louder.  But that is to be expected in a sports bar, but wanted to mention it. I would eat here again becuase it was easy for an out-of-towner.",3.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"They say location is everything, and Yard House has certainly taken advantage. So many things to fix at this place. Overpriced, incredibly slow, mediocre food, often room temperature food (but send something back at your own risk, as everyone else will be done eating by the time they come back with hot food). Honestly, with such an enormous staff, how can service be so slow and food be consistently not hot?  Since you have runners for everything, what exactly do you need a waitstaff for? Put tablets on each table and let people order what they want right from the device.  There's always a line out the door in part because this place is incredibly inefficient And the extensive beer menu is impressive but it only works if you can keep all that draft beer fresh, which is not the case. Gave them another chance this week despite low expectations and, congratulations, you met them, with very mediocre service and mediocre, lukewarm food.

I'm giving yard house 3 stars cause my first visit New Year's Eve the restaurant was empty and we wanted a bite before going out to party. The service and food New Year's Eve was ridiculously good. Had the fish tacos and they were to die for so imagine my surprise when 3 months later we came back to the same location for my nieces bday and the service and food was blah. It was also Saturday afternoon so it was busier and what's with the change of servers midway thru our party? Fish tacos were not as tasty as my first they were over flooded on toppings and the fish was soggy ugh the pizza and burgers the kids ordered were bland and our first server was a hot mess forgetting our orders and never checking up on us.

When the service level doesn't meet the price, that's where you lose me. This last visit though was by far the worst. We sat at the bar (it was a Wednesday night, so not busy) and the bartender (Julie) looked like she would rather do anything than deal with any of us customers. She took my boyfriend's empty beer glass and just walked away not asking if he would like another. My sister-in-law received the incorrect order and when we told her that we sent it back her response was ""oh ok"" What??? No, I am sorry or let me check on it, nothing.

"Moe, our server was great, kudos to her but I was not impressed with the food. My bff's and I went there to celebrate a special occasion. Friend #1 ordered a kale salad with the ceasar dressing on the side but requested an olive oil and lemon dressing as well. The salad was mostly romaine lettuce and no oil/lemon dressing. The server had to ask her helper twice to get the other dressing. Friend #2 ordered a sandwich with truffle fries, fries were cold. Moe took them back and came back with another plate which was also cold, third try the fries came back hot but she was almost finished with her sandwich.

"Love this place! Great vibes, great food, huge beer (they let you try samples) and drink list-and awesome location setting. The menu has a variety of yummy options. I have had the chicken and avocado sandwich which is amazing, the garlic and sweet potato fries which are super yummy, the edamame which is to DIE for and lastly, I've had their tacos. Stay away from those in my opinion... They don't have much flavor. An order comes with rice and beans which definitely has no flavor. I complained to my waiter about that and he was really nice about it and took my suggestion of adding Latin flavors to that dish. Aside from that, all is great. The servers are friendly and willing to give drink/food suggestions. The bar area is filled with large TVs which is great for game day.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"I discovered this place while I was in Hawaii actually and was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a location 40 minutes away from me.  I came here yesterday for lunch after passing it on my way home from upstate.  It wasn't overwhelmingly crowded since it was Labor Day, but yet our waiter was still so frazzled and pretty slow.  Whatever, it was a nice day outside so I was happy to sit out there instead of in the car.  I ordered the vegan burger which I must say might be one of my favorite vegan burgers I have ever had.  It was so unique and different.  They call it a ""featured"" item so I really hope that means that they don't get rid of it after the summer.  This is a perfect place to come for meat eaters, vegans, vegetarians, beer lovers (HUGE beer selection), and everyone in between.  Wish they would open one on Long Island so I didn't have to pay a toll just to come and eat here.",4.0,"237 Market St, Yonkers, NY 10701",Yard House

"This is really a 3.75 star review. Seasons has the perfect atmosphere. Warm, woody, tan-y tones, candlelit tables, open kitchen. Piped in music. Very welcoming. Service: In most aspects, unfortunately so much was left to be desired. We had our reservation set for over a week, so staffing should've been prepared for a table of 18. We surmised that it could've been the fact that they were extremely busy for a Tuesday night and the days happenstance may have occurred. The one and only waitress we had for the evening, who played both server and busboy, was quite pleasant considering the short staffing issues. In fact, everyone I encountered were professional and friendly, pluses to them for that. Apps & Entrées : No bread baskets present. And water was quite scarce. My boss had to order flatbread half hour into our wait to calm these hungry patrons down. Sadly, the Chicken Arugula flatbread, my Asparagus soup and the inexpensive happy hour drinks, were the best things I had that evening. My entrée of Filet Mignon, though tender, was unfortunately nothing but salt. The stars on my plate were the flavorful mashed potatoes and sautéed Asparagus. These sentiments were shared by all who ordered the same entrée. Water was much needed, so our second-line exec., had to ask for pitchers of water for our entire table. Dessert: The shot glass dessert tower looked very impressive. I chose the strawbery rhubarb shot, which had no tartness of rhubarb, which was a fail for me. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their options. So a quarter star goes to them for the majority win. All and all we had a good time, laughing, chatting, and trying to convince our boss to give us the day off, which didn't happen.  Oh well, we tried. Despite all the faux pas, I would actually come back and try them again...with a smaller group.

"Great place to come sit at the bar for Happy Hour! It's probably my favorite spot in this part of town. They have a great HH option where you get two glasses of wine and a flatbread for $15. We usually start with this option and then move on to cocktails if feeling inclined to do so. The bartenders are willing to work with you and make tweaks in their cocktails if they're able to. J always asks for the cocktails to be less sweet. The HH food options are pretty diverse. They have scallops, lamb, duck, vegetarian, etc etc. The only negative comment I have on Seasons 52 is that the food quality seems to have fallen a bit since they first opened. It used to be that their flatbreads were perfectly cooked and served bubbly hot, but these days they're served kinda burnt and tepid. Won't stop me from going again and again, but for first timers, I can see why they wouldn't consider revisiting. I do love that their desserts are teeny tiny and served in shot glasses. They're delicious and almost guilt free. My favorite is the chocolate cake with peanut butter. They used to have a piano inside the bar where someone would play live music which was so awesome and added a lot to the ambiance of the place. I wish they would bring that back!  But, they've since built some sorta table and placed liquor bottles in that spot so I don't think they will anytime soon.

"Last night, my wife and I headed to Seasons 52 for a romantic (and delicious) Valentine's Day dinner. Since we had been to Seasons 52 about 3-4 times previously, we of course expected a terrific experience. When we arrived at our scheduled reservation time, we were told we'd have to wait about 20 minutes (a little inconvenient but nothing unexpected for Valentine's Day) but that we could grab some free champagne from the nearby table (now we're talking). We grabbed the champagne and within 20 minutes were called to head to our table. From there, the experience was everything we'd come to love about this place. Within a few minutes, our waitress came over to take our drink orders. My wife and I were craving different white wines and asked for our server's suggestions. She helped my wife pick a sweet Riesling and helped me to pick an oaky Chardonnay. We both loved the personalized choices (she nailed our taste buds!). From there, we ordered the roasted whole cauliflower appetizer (covered with four kinds of cheeses), which had a strong cauliflower taste (they literally bring a whole cauliflower to your table) and was greatly complimented by the cheeses. For dinner, my wife ordered the sea scallops and I chose the Chilean sea bass. My wife absolutely loved the scallops and I likewise really enjoyed the Chilean sea bass, which had just the right texture and flavor and was greatly complimented by the black rice (so delicious), snow peas and miso glaze (so good). Although we were both full, we of course left room for those famous dessert shooters (a must get). We ordered a couple of decaf coffees, and shortly thereafter our waitress brought over the tray of heaven in shot glasses. I of course had to go with the Valentine's Day special (dark chocolate raspberry - holy cow was it amazing!) and my wife had the caramel. We both finished our shooters despite being full because they're just that good (and small enough to enjoy after a large meal). Throughout the experience, the entire staff (especially our waitress) was incredibly friendly, accommodating and pleasant. We also enjoyed the romantic ambiance.

You can never go wrong with grass fed beef! The meatloaf fell apart so easily and went well with the yukon mash. Match made in heaven.

"Tis the season, well any season is the season at Seasons 52! Okay, kind of corny, I know, but seriously, it's pretty cool that a restaurant bases a portion of their menu on the weather outside. Yeah, you can get seasonal specials at many restaurants, but not like here. The reason for dinner wasn't for any specifics except my girlfriend hearing great things about the place and wanting something on the healthier side. I had been here once years ago and remembered basically enjoying it. But now my mind is of the Yelp caliber so I was mildly concerned (not anymore!). To start, you need a reservation (at least on a weekend). A family walked in and was quoted 3 hours! Glad I Opentabled a few days before. Once you check in with the hostess, take a look around. There's a contemporary suaveness about the place. It's not pretentious, maybe a little loud in parts, but there's enough coziness (especially in the back Napa Room) that, by the end of your meal, you almost won't want to leave. The other reason you might not wanna vamoose is the service. Our waiter, Willy, was a class act. Humble, helpful, funny, and a pleasure from start to finish. If the owner/manager of S52 is reading this, then give Willy a raise! Beyond Willy, is that aforementioned menu. It's dated by the week, because you never know what might change. For instance, my GF had the harvest wine to start. Not something you can get everyday (and apparently no where other than here!). Crisp and sweet and just what she wanted. I went with a beer (Fire Island Red Wagon IPA) and then it was food time. We started with one of the flatbreads (garlic chicken pesto) and this was just awesome. Light on the bread and heavy on the flavor. Just as we took our final bite, the main dishes approached (perfect timing). The lady ordered the BBQ chicken salad while I got Southern-style shrimp and grits. Wow. Wow to both! That salad comes in a cylinder and is then spread about the plate. It keeps everything together nicely and has amazing taste between the fresh chicken, peppers, pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, and Gorgonzola. As for my shrimp and grits, I love this type of dish and it did not disappoint. It wasn't broadcasted as spicy, but creamy instead. That's what I got with some delicious cheddar grits topped by tender shrimp, chorizo, and bacon in a tomato sauce. I took my final bite and was feeling glorious. But wait! Dessert! A true original of Seasons is their dessert shots. $3 a pop and they're small enough to not feel like you've overeaten, but just the right size that your sweet tooth will be satisfied. The girlfriend had a caramel macchiato one and I went for the chocolate peanut butter. Tastiness in a tiny glass. I mean, you could have two if you really want (I won't judge ya!). Overall, Seasons 52 is a true restaurant gem. They hit on all cylinders when it comes to food, service, and ambiance. Okay, they're not necessarily the cheapest meal in the world, but you can mix and match flatbreads and starters to create a pretty reasonably-priced outing. So go forth, in rain, leaves, snow, or sun, and enjoy a sensationally seasonal meal all your own.",5.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"I was extremely impressed with this restaurant. I tried it because of restaurant week coming to Long Island and my mom lives there. The deal was $29 per person for a 3 course meal. Definitely a good deal since the mains were about $23+ on the regular menu. Since there were 4 people we got to try almost everything on the special menu. We started with their prosciutto asparagus flat bread and that was sooo good. Very flat which we weren't expecting, but perfect to start with. The Caesar salad was amazing. The dressing was perfect. Not too creamy. Tried the asparagus soup. That was very fresh and clean tasting. For the mains our table had the tuna, the roasted chicken, the short rib, and the filet mignon. The steak was hands down the best. It had the perfect sear to it and flavoring and the meat was so tender. The short rib was a close second. The short rib was like butter. The glaze it was in was sooo good. And the mashed potatoes were I think au gratin and they were one of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. The tuna was seared perfectly and was so fresh. It was served over some black organic rice that had a sort of lavender flavor to it that was so nice. The chicken was also so so good. Everything really was amazing. The desserts we had were served in these mini shot glasses. They were so so good. We had the pecan pie, the key lime pie, the peanut butter chocolate cake, and the inside out cannoli which was my personal favorite. The space itself was very nice. Only thing is the lighting was a bit dark. Definitely had a romantic feel to it. Our waiter Ed was great too. He actually got my last name from the reservation and learned how to pronounce it before we came! My name is a little complicated so I'm not used to people knowing how to pronounce it.

The artichokes were cooked to perfection with the most magical taste. The chicken skewers were so tender and fall-tasting... cranberries and  apple slaw were a great flavor combo for the new fall menu. My pear martini was SO refreshing. We both opted to get salads for our entree as it was  a late lunch. My friend got the Thai steak and noodle. I don't even eat meat but just HAD to try it looked so good. It didn't let my taste buds down. It was cooked medium rare as Jerome (who was so knowledgeable and very pleasant) mentioned it would be. I got the Caesar salad. Dressing was just enough with delightfully flavored croutons. Hit the spot and was a nice sized portion. We weren't going to get dessert but Jeremy really sold us when showing the cute little shooters they came in. We got the carrot cake and the pecan pie. Thank goodness he walked away or I would have ate the entire platter of the rest of them. Nothing but great things from Seasons. Really want to go back soon!

They had just begun their spring menu so we ordered the asparagus, prosciutto, camember flatbread and two glasses of red wine.  Great combo. We then had the spinach salad with strawberries and cumin dressing.  You wouldn't think the flavors would match, but it was perfect. For dinner, my wife ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon while I had the Wood-Grilled Handline Tuna with black rice.  My wife said her Salmon was the best she's ever had.  It was cooked to perfection.  My Tuna with the black rice was excellent. We finished with a duo of their mini desserts; key lime and rubarb cheesecake. I would highly recommend giving Seasons 52 a try.  And definitely ask for Jenny!  :-)",5.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Great night at seasons 52!  The atmosphere in this restaurant is great. The downstairs area had cozy vibe however unfortunately they were packed and had to put several groups upstairs in a makeshift dining area where they normally have private events. We were a bit disappointed in that. We started off with chicken pesto flatbread which was outstanding. Next, our waiter guided us away from the Thai steak salad we were thinking of getting and instead advised the salmon salad. We found the salmon salad disappointing. The salmon was solid but the rest of the salad was mediocre. Lastly, we got the short rib which was a winner. The risotto it comes on is outstanding. Overall, great place. Will be back to try other items on the extensive menu",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
I came here for happy hour and to try the hello spring menu. The happy hour prices were good and I had the Hawaiian pineapple cosmo and the sangria. Definitely will return for my happy hours! I went around 5pm and the place was not packed and we were to find a place at the bar. For dinner I had the asparagus soup which was delicious and the wooden filet mignon medium well. The menu also includes a mini dessert which was okay. I had hoped it would been at least two mini desserts.,4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Our server Drew though! He was the truth. I have never ever in my life met such a down-to-earth and honest waiter. For every question we had, he had an answer and for every qualm we had, he was able to fix it. He caught on when I stood up out of my seat and slyly told him that it was the other persons birthday without missing a beat. He understood our dry-humor. The hostess, who greeted us upon arrival was friendly and attentive and I saw several managers walking around to make sure things were on the up and up. I enjoyed this place for more than one reason. For one thing, they serve food that is in season (meaning it is currently grown, farmed or whatever); for another, the desert menu has reasonably sized portions (no need to have a humungous slice of cake after a full meal with appetizers and possible drinks, just something small to meet those sweet tooth needs); there is this delicious agave-ginger drink that is superb; the restaurant is cozy and has a space for private events; and the bathrooms are very clean.

"I came by here for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. Service was great! We started with a bunch of appetizers- three flatbreads, baked cauliflower, stuffed mushrooms, and duck wings. I really enjoyed the mozzarella and lobster flatbread. For my main course, I had the grilled scallops with risotto. Everything was flavorful. I really like that they have a seasonal menu and the fact that they're health conscious. The restaurant provided us with a gift card for our next visit. That was so sweet!

I don't regret it, loved every bite, especially the artichoke which was so juicy and soft. The lobster flatbread was so thin, I loved it. The shrimp scampi had a unique flavor and the vegetables in it was just as delicious. The filet mignon was also super tender and easy to bite (I ordered medium well) and it was slightly pink which was perfect.

"I came here with a friend while I was visiting New York for New Year's Eve. The restaurant was great and I have no complaints about the food, staff, or service. My only complaint, and reason for docking a star, is that we were seating 30 minutes after our reservation time. I understand it was NYE and that it was busy but so many people were backed up and our table was only for two. I had a glass of wine and salmon dish. If I'm in the neighborhood again I'll definitely try it out.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"I was very unhappy with our service here. Maybe it was my fault because I said let's try something new! When we walked in the ambiance was beautiful so I was very hopeful! Unfortunately things went quickly downhill.  Let's start with the 2 groups that were seated before us even though they came after we got there. It was only after we directed it to the hostess's attention that she tried to pass it off on her colleague saying ""Oh she must have missed your ticket"".  We were literally standing in front of her. She then seats as herself. A few minutes later a random woman comes over and stoops next to our table asking us what's the problem. We blink at her for a minute trying to figure out who she is and what she needs. After an awkward moment she explains that the hostess told her that  we were unhappy about something. Clearly the hostess never explained to her what the problem was and never told us  that she would be sending over a manager to speak with us. We explain what the problem was and she passes it off with some incoherent response that left us confused. Essentially telling us that our service would get better. It didn't. We ordered Ginger ale only to find out that there was something wrong with the machine  So we got some weird tasting liquid instead. At least the server caught it after he brought it to our table. I then attempted to order the meat loaf only to be told that  they were all out.   Later we were told that it was cooking and would take a long  time. The plate they brought for appetizers was dirty and had to be returned. At this point this restaurant was batting 0 for a 1000. The saving grace for this place was the decor that the food was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly even though they never asked me how I wanted it.  I would have been screwed if I didn't like my meat  medium rare and red.  The beef short ribs were good as well and perfectly portioned. But at the end of the day, you couldn't pay me to go back.",1.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

First I had the pomegranate margarita martini say what! strong and nicely salted, for appetizers duck wing lollipops fall off the bone goodness with a little kick but not too much. The flat bread chicken garlic pesto was crispy and tasty I wanted another. I ordered the Mahi- Mahi tacos with potato salad as a side, can I say home run delicious it would slap Aaron Jude four times Lol. Amy our server was fantastic she catered to our every need.

"This is my first time going to Seasons 52, looking into the restaurant you get the impression its a very fancy expensive restaurant, because of the decor.  But once inside and sitting down at your table looking at the menu, the prices are very reasonable.  Here's my reason why I'm giving Seasons 52 only 1 star.  We ordered 4 appetizers and everything was very good, for my entree I ordered the New York strip 13oz med rare, but when I got the steak it was more like rare.  I called over the lady and she was saying is there something wrong? I said yes, my steak is not cooked to med rare, she took my steak back and bought it back to me 10 mins later.  The steak was cooked the way I liked and the entire night was very good.  Great service by the person servicing our table.  But after I got home I started to feel sick and constantly going to the bathroom and wanted to throw up.  The next day was even worst, my body was aching and felt cold, probably went to the bathroom 20 times.  I knew I got food poisoning and I asked the other 3 guests if they got any problems?  None of them had any symptoms, I ate bad steak that causes the food poisoning.  So, for the next 3 days I was at home suffering from food poisoning.",1.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"While visiting the Roosevelt Field Mall area, I came here for the first time due to the recommendation of someone who frequents this place. Although Seasons 52 is of a chain restaurant, I noticed that it is on the higher upscale end. The food is a bit more pricey and even the environment seems fancy and the place is more dimly lit. For the first experience, I have nothing bad to say. When I walked in with my mom and her friend, we got seated right away. I got to try the tomato flatbread that we all shared. It tasted like sun dried tomatoes. It wasn't amazing, but it was a decent appetizer to start with. As for my main course, I took a look at the menu and decided to go with the ""handheld"" option with includes a side. I personally got the Crispy Braised Short Rib Sandwich with a side of Wood-Grilled Potato Salad. Although I'm not a big fan of the small cilantro pieces inside, the short rib meat and the sauce made up for the taste. Together with the potato salad, surprisingly I was pretty full by the end of it all. The service was fairly quick and the waiter that we had was pretty attentive to us. In general, it was a good experience.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Always a fan of Seasons 52! This is the first location I ever visited and therefore the reason for my addiction. This location is clean and looks like the rest. The lighting is low which makes for a nice relaxing meal. The staff is friendly, yet somewhat unprofessional here. My latest visit I went for lunch with a good friend and it was very slow. We went on a Thursday around 1pm. Our waitress was kind and patient however there were other waiters standing around and goofing off. My friend had her 9 month old baby and one of the waiters passed by our table and started jumping and flailing around to ""entertain"" the baby. We were all a bit puzzled by this including the baby. Their food is always consistent and their desserts are scrumptious. I highly recommend getting the crab cake sandwich on the lunch menu with a side of the potato salad.

"I came with my boyfriend here for a celebration of life for one of his friends. So I can only comment on the catering and food. Overall, with so many people the people catering did a decent job of asking us what all wanted to drink. And they also brought appetizers but I think that wasn't really spread throughout the tables since I only had a chance to try one out if two of them. But the one I tried was pretty good. However if you're not a fan of shallots, maybe do not go for the one that I believe has pesto since there were large shallot chunks on them with arugula. Next came the entrees which took a decent amount of time to make but for so many people, I'm sure their kitchen was chaotic. My salmon dish as done well, I don't really have a lot of bad things to say about it. It's not too memorable but not bad. My boyfriend said his steak was not a medium - in fact, looked well done. Perhaps it was someone else's and not his? Not sure at this point. He also said it was a tad salty. And then came the desserts which undoubtedly was my favorite.

I ordered Chilean sea bass on top of black rice. It was perfect. I had some of my wife's New York steak. I could cut it with a fork. Then desert, desert was above and beyond.

"I had my first date with my now fiancé. We come to this restaurant plenty of times To celebrate Friday nights, birthdays and family dinners. We do love and enjoy the food. I can't help mention if your on diet, specially calorie counting this is the place. The menu is has the calories next to all food. My favorite entrée is the sea scallops, which came with a butternut squash risotto and broccolini. I loved it. Full of flavor. Sadly this is always my go to dish. We do order the flat breads, which are all delicious. I specially love the pesto flat bread. My fiancé and brother loves the lamb lollipops. Whenever you order the side vegetables, they always come in a rustic mason jar. I love that mason jar. There is parking, however they offer valet parking. This is the best for Friday and Saturday nights. We personally never used valet parking. As you walk-in you're greeted by the hostess. You're able to make reservations. If you walk-in depending on the day and time you may have a wait. That's when you make the bar useful. They have amazing cocktail list and even better wine list. There were times the service off bit off. Like forgetting the fork and charging for a soup that's ordered but never brought to us. Of course, this was one time and that's the reason we keep coming back. Now for the dessert, they bring around they shot glasses, filled with amazing puddings, cake and pies. From memories the calories are about 200-300 per glass. You can select as much as you want. Of course, that defies the purpose the calories. My favorite is the cheesecake and chocolate mousse.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"The good: Beautiful place. Perfectly lit. Good setting for a romantic night or a group dinner that you want to be semi formal. Wait staff was professional and timely. Food was presented well. The bad: The food was not that good. The BBQ meatloaf was drowned in BBQ sauce when it was described as ""a little in the center"". The mashed Yukon potatoes were dry and tasteless. The lamb shank was good but the sides were also dry and bland. The dessert are presented to each table at the end of the meal as a selection of 7 small cups of different desserts and you choose which you want (if any). Problem is each waiter and table is talking over and touching the selections. And which ever you don't choose is then presented to the next table so they can then talk, touch and choose. Not sanitary at all. The ugly: Unprofessional valet I know. It's a valet what do I expect. Their hats and uniforms were disheveled as if they were hanging out on a Friday night rather than working. They were hanging together and talking to each other unprofessionally in front of waiting customers. We got our car back with the drivers seat in an almost lay flat position as if someone was sleeping in it. They change their menu each season so there is a possibility we go back to give it one more shot but at this point it's hard to recommend as there are so many middle tier restaurants like this one that are so much better.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Came to Season 52 this past weekend for a Bachelorette weekend and had a great experience. The valet parking was essential as it was a seriously cold night and there was limited parking. As long as you dine at Seasons 52, your ticket will be validated so that you do not need to pay for valet. The place was crankin' when we walked in. People were standing around the waiting area for tables, bar was busy and the tables were full. We were a party of seven and minutes after walking in we were escorted upstairs to a private room, which was actually really nice. The room had maybe five or so tables set up and at the time of our arrival (7pm) we were the only party in that room. It was nice to be able to hear each other talk throughout our meal. The service was good, very nice waiter who offered to take pictures for us. We did a champagne toast at the beginning of the meal for our bride, which was great. We ordered a bottle of prosecco for the table too. For appetizers we ordered two flatbreads; the roasted roma tomato and the garlic pesto. They did offer gluten sensitive flatbread, which was cool and appreciated. We went with the regular one though and it was very tasty, great for sharing and an awesome presentation on a rustic wooden display board. We also ordered the crab shrimp and spinach stuffed mushrooms that were fine but another flatbread would have been better in my opinion as the mushrooms were kind of small and not too memorable. They had an impressive wine list too, tons of options by the glass, something for everyone, and then some. The menu was appreciated because the calorie count was on there. Some people hate that because their mindset is when they dine out they don't want to know how bad their eating they just want to enjoy themselves. For me personally, listing the calories was great and helped me decide what to order. It was obvious that their food had fewer calories than most restaurant you dine at. Picture the lighter fare section on some restaurants menus and this was the entire menu here at Seasons 52. Lots of seafood and meat options and salads too. The waiter emphasized that they use fresh seasonally appropriate ingredients and therefore adjust there menu accordingly. There were a lot of winter ingredients like potatoes and root vegetables. Choosing the tuna steak was a good idea. Although I   am definitely partial to pan seared sesame crusted tuna, the tuna dish on the menu was good. Slightly bland, which to be honest, I     didn't mind because I    have a serious aversion to salt. The tuna steak was served with a tiny kohlrabi salad on top and the tuna steak was sitting on a lump of black rice. The black rice was tasteless, again, I   was fine with that because I   prefer bland food over overly salted food but other might want a bit more flavor. Hey, there's a reason the dishes are under 700 calories, you know? It seemed that everyone else enjoyed their food at the table as well, we had a mixture of scallop, salmon, steak, tuna, you name it. I   appreciate leaving a dining experience and not feeling bloated, full and mad at myself for a night out. It made me feel less guilty for going back and eating milk duds, raisinets and twizzlers all night long. For dessert, they brought these little glasses with different concoctions. One was peanut butter and chocolate, another raspberry cannoli, carrot cake in another one, I   forget the others but they were essentially mini desserts. Everyone chose a different one and enjoyed them. The coffee was just alright, they had whole milk and half and half for cream options. I   thought a place like Seasons 52 might have soy or almond milk or skim milk considering the healthy nature of the place but not a big deal. Overall it was a very nice experience and I   would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to dine solo, with another individual or with a larger party.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

The ambiance was quite nice, restaurant was not busy, service was only okay and the food was mediocre at best. I got the Maui New York strip (off their dinner menu) while my husband got the lump crab cake sandwich and a bowl of grass-fed beef & black bean chili. The food came out fairly fast but our waitress was always nowhere to be found. My steak was definitely overdone while I requested medium rare because it was dry, chewy and underseasoned. The string beans was overcooked and the ends were not trimmed. My husband's crab cake sandwich was not good nor did it look appealing. The crab cake was very bland and seemed to have too much filler in it. The only thing good was the bowl of chili.

Waitress experience affects 70% of your dining experience. Jenny was passive aggressively rude. When I asked for more coffee her response is I will get you more coffee when I have time. She also asked what side I wanted with my brunch burger. Gave me choices and I said broccoli. When we got out food she forgot to tell me she was wrong and my dish doesn't come with a side. Had I known I would have still ordered a side of broccoli.

The salad barely had any dressing. The plus on the entree was that it was decent sized. But the chicken and mashed potatoes were kind of flavorless. They burnt my friends chicken and gave her a tiny bit of gravy. The mini dessert cups were whatever too.

"I've been holding up on writing a review of Seasons 52 because I have such mixed feelings. After dinning here 4 times now I can honestly say that each experience has been different. First of all I have to say that I absolutely love that they have an ever changing menu that is fresh and goes with the current season. Also, that they attempt to give you a calorie count of the foods you are consuming. Even though that's pretty hard to keep accurate. My first 3 trips here were for lunch. Food was great! I especially love their seabass with forbidden black rice. This item seems to be a staple on the menu and with good reason. The thing that's not so great about lunch is the amount of time spent waiting. Waiting for a server, waiting for your meal, waiting for your server again. Last lunch trip took us 2 hours from start to finish and that's with me having to get up and find someone to give me a check. On my last visit it was dinner time and since I haven't had much luck in the dinning room I figured let me sit at the bar this time around. Bartender was awesome! Unfortunately this time my food wasn't. I had a crabcake that was awful, butternut squash ravioli that was has hard as a rock and deviled eggs (a favorite of mine) that tasted like celery.

"We came to Seasons 52 because I get 1,000 points for using my American Express!! Bonus!! My wife ate at Seasons multiple times at the Woodbridge location and was raving about it because the menu changes (it's a seasonal restaurant, hence the name). One of the things I find highly annoying is when you walk into a restaurant and it nearly empty and the hostess asks you if you have reservations and when you say no they have to take a name down. We sat around looking out of place when there is open tables in most of the restaurants. About 5 to 10 mins later we were seated. We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. The crab cake was served like a pancake with a salad, the crab cake was good and the salad was amazing. For the entree I ordered the wood grilled New York strip medium. The steak came out perfectly cooked medium! My only negative was the steak was very under seasoned, there was no salt or pepper anywhere on the steak. They have spoon with rock salt on the side, I get the concept that some people don't like salty food but to have no salt and pepper on the steak is a crime! I kept on going to the salt and adding it on to my steak which was annoying. The dish also came with Yukon gold mash potatoes and steamed vegetables. The mashed potatoes were under seasoned as well, I kept on adding salt then it became over salted because every bite I took had no seasoning. The vegetables were bland and no seasoning either, it felt like it was frozen vegetables thawed then boiled! I didn't even try to finish the vegetables. My wife ordered the artichoke flat bread which was alright not amazing. On to the dessert, they come out with this tray of different types of mousses. I choose the one that tasted like a Reese's cup, it would have been amazingly good if it was chilled it was lukewarm and when I looked over at the kitchen it seem like it was sitting under the heated light. After a meal like that I would have expected a chilled dessert and not a warm one! Other then getting the points for my card I would not return to Seasons 52.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Great experience honestly. I have nothing bad to say. I came here about 3 or 4 years ago for Mother's Day & had the lamb chops that were absolutely amazing. So we wanted something different & I remembered this place. We got seated quickly, everyone was friendly from the hostess to our server. They also had a really good sense of humor considering I tend to be a clown at times :-D Boo thang & I both had the salmon except he haf some special Alaskan wild salmon that is apparently only caught once a year ( recommended by our server) and I had the cedar plank salmon which was recommended by the hostess when I asked what her favorite dish was. May I add that she stated the salmon with no hesitation or pause! I really need to start getting some names haha sorry guys! Anyway, check the flicks, they were both delicious & I don't have anything to else to say honestly. The server sauce right away, the drinks came quick and the food came pretty quick.

"Had a 5pm RSVP via open table for 1000 points. The bartender at the bar didn't have ginger beer for the prairie mule drink I ordered but after searching for it, instead used agave syrup as a substitute. I appreciate the effort in still making the drink that was ordered. It has a City Cellar feel if you're familiar with that restaurant. I enjoyed the experience and the food speaks for itself. Good: -Duck Wing Lollipops appetizer if you're in the mood for chicken wings -Lobster & mozzarella flatbread is 2 thumbs up and should be required -Caramelized sea scallops have risotto and cauliflower mashed together -Grilled Fillet Mignon ordered medium was perfect for me -Truffle Macaroni and Cheese side -Lobster tail accompaniment was juicy and easy to eat -Prairie Mule drinks -Appetizers came to the table quickly -RSVP on OpenTable for 1000 points -Happy hour M-F 4pm-6:30pm Bad: -None",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

I came here today for my Mom's Birthday celebration after sitting all day scrolling through dozens of other restaurant picks on Yelp that could have been the ""lucky"" choice. I was so happy I picked this spot. The server I had was named Cory. Where do I even start with this one. He greeted my family with a smile on his face, was so attentive to our orders, SUPER polite, took our empty plates when we were finished, and was so easy to ask questions from. I can't even begin to praise this guy enough. Most servers would disappear and not show up again until its time for dessert or to give you the bill, but not Cory! He was always around making sure everything was alright and that we were enjoying everything. AUGH....Cory, where have you been all my life???? every restaurant needs a Cory!!! The food was down right amazing! My mom LOVED the sea bass, it was cooked just right. The Scallops were seasoned just right and the filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious! All the food that was ordered was not heavily seasoned or super salty like other places I have been to. This was the breaking point on why I loved this place so much! I am so going to return to this spot for another celebration dinner, but I will make sure to call ahead of time and request that Cory must be there!

I had called in advance to make sure it was appropriate to bring a small child, since I know this location is a little more upscale and they were very welcoming.  The service was absolutely wonderful from start to finish and everyone really enjoyed their meal.  When our son became a little loud (happy noises, but still no one likes to hear a little kid making noise during dinner) my husband and i were taking turns walking him around outside the restaurant, and they were very kind with the timing of our food as a result.  The menu had a some really good healthy options, which I appreciated and my son ended up eating a lot of my salmon, which I do agree was quite good. The little desserts at the end were a perfect way to finish off the meal.  Top marks across the board.

Let me rewind a few months back..... yelp.com/biz/yelp-elite-… I attended a YEE with my favorite side kick, my son. It was a Spring tasting. Beautiful private room with several food stations. Food was good but I wasn't blown away. The staff was outstanding. A raffle was won....$52 gift certificate, to me! So here I am, in the area finally & I intend to feast accordingly. I am greeted by a friendly professional young guy who takes me to my table. Kayla my waitress comes over & introduces herself. She explains the specials & asks if I have any questions. I peruse the menu & decide on the Watermelon Agua Fresca. It sounded refreshing & I think Darci had one & it looked good. I start with the Duck Wing Lollipops. Meaty pieces of duck on the bone. If you know me, you know I LOVE my meat & fish bones intact! That's where all the flavor is people! They were moist yet crispy on the outside with a sweet salty glaze. Do yourself a favor & try them. I finally decided on the Lobster Pappardelle. Maine Lobster sautéed with tomatoes, asparagus & peas in a light sherry cream sauce. The flavor was richly flavored but light. My only issue was the pappardelle. Although cooked al dente there were a lot of pieces glued together. You know when you cook pasta but don't stir it so it gums up together. Not good. But I took no stars off because everything else was top notch. Last but definitely not least, dessert. Those delicious mini desserts! Words cannot describe how much flavor they pack into those little shot glasses. I got the Pecan Pie, Raspberry or was it Strawberry Cannoli, & Key Lime Pie. PERFECTION in a shot glass! The whole time Kayla was very attentive without hovering. She attended my every need with a smile & genuine concern. She was a pleasure & my meal was outstanding. So I ate like a Queen today.....

"RECOMMENDED I dined at Seasons 52 with twelve members of my dining group on Friday, 6/10.This restaurant is in a large, hip and attractive space. The menu is extensive and it was, frankly, hard to choose what to order since so many options looked appealing.Dinner started with a very stiff and delicious  Vodka Martini. It was a very generous sized drink with an additional amount  left to pour in the canister. The very nice bartender, overhearing that I forgot my reading glasses, promptly loaned me a house pair. The Maitre D' seated us promptly in a gratis private room with a curtain. I appreciated that immensely, as did my fellow diners, because the restaurant seems to be very popular and loud on Friday evenings. Our server was extremely pleasant and accommodating. The kitchen was rather slow, however. I chose Crab Cakes as one of my starters. They were flavorful. I also shared one of the Flat Breads with another diner and sampled the Lobster Flatbread ordered by another diner. The Flat Breads here are excellent. I will order them again when I return. Other appetizers which drew favorable comment were the Stuffed Mushrooms and the Duck Lollipops. I chose Rainbow Trout as my entree. It was fresh and tasty but a little overcooked and dry. Another diner had the same opinion. Other diners, however, mentioned that they really liked the Salmon dishes, both Wild Alaskan and Cedar Plank.Other entrees that members praised include the Filet Mignon, Short Ribs, Lamb Chops and Lobster Pappardelle. The latter dish looked amazing and I wished I had ordered it. The restaurant features desserts which are small-portioned for the sake of waistlines but extremely reasonably priced.

"Came here last night (Friday night) with my friend for our first time. **VERY LIMITED PARKING OR YOU CAN PAY $7 FOR VALET** We had a 9pm reservation and had to wait until roughly 9:10pm to be officially seated. The hostess seemed to be a little overwhelmed. There was a wait for new customers walking in we also heard. Some people were really dressed up with heels and buttons downs while we saw others wearing t-shirts and jeans shorts. I think you can go in the middle but I'd say more towards the dresser side. Daniel was our waiter and was very sweet and helpful with the menu. We started with a French Martini and a Gin Specialty Cocktail. Both were tasty, but could have been a little better with the poor. For an appetizer we shared the Pesto Garlic Chicken Flatbread. Very thin, crispy flat bread full of flavor and great for two to share. For entrees we had the Lobster Paradella and Caramelized Scallops. I don't even like Scallops and I thought they were delicious! We couldn't finish either entree that we had it wrapped. Daniel packed our to-go bags at our table. We both decided to switch to wine. Daniel let us try our selected wine prior to officially ordering it which was a great touch. For dessert he brought out a platter which consisted of these mini dessert shots, I'd say about 6 different ones. He explained what each one was into detail. I had the PB and Chocolate one and my friend had the Strawberry Canoli. We were in loveeee...we wanted more! But we were good and said check please :) Reasonably priced, bill was $129, plus tip.

"My wife and I were in the area so we decided to give this place a try. There was a wait of an hour but we decided to stick it out. After we were seated, our waiter came by promptly and listed the specials of day. We took few more minutes and placed our order. After taking the order our waiter disappeared. About fifteen minutes later he brought our appetizer of duck lollipop. It was drenched in sauce but I thought it was ok, nothing special. He disappeared again  until my wife asked me to get his attention and ask for some bread which I did. Again it took a while for the bread to come out and when it did finally arrive it wasn't him who brought it out. Some more wait, he came back and took the appetizer plates and utensils. When the food finally arrived (wasn't the waiter), we had no utensils and had to ask another waitress to bring some utensils. She quickly drop them off and ran off. I had ordered a steak so before I can even ask for a steak knife she was gone. So I just continued using the butter knife but my wife got really upset about how absent minded our waiter was. She finally got his attention and asked for a steak knife. I was half way done by this time. He came back and brought the steak and left. Didn't ask how our food was or if we needed anything else or if I wanted to refill my coke. He disappeared again until we finished our meal. We sat around just chatting, he came by and cleaned up our table and left. Again didn't ask if he should bring the desserts out or anything. Sometime later he came back and brought out some desserts, we took 2 and he disappeared yet again. Didn't ask if we wanted coffee or anything. I didn't want coffee so I didn't care but apparently my wife did but because he didn't ask she didn't order. Ok, so let's get this straight so it doesn't seem like I'm just moaning for no good reason. He did his job, got our food and brought out what we asked for and nothing more. But I have big problem when it is expected that the patrons pay up to 20% in tips. My question is what are we paying the tip for? Why are patrons obligated to give a tip? Shouldn't the tip be earned by providing good service? This has become a huge problem in the restaurant industry where the owners don't pay their employees enough but have passed that cost along to their customers and expect that patrons give generous tips for their shitty servers. My last three visits to different restaurants have been the same. I'm not a demanding customer, I don't have weird requests, my orders are generally exactly as they are in the menu. All I want is that if I'm expected to give a generous tip that the waiter be attentive and perhaps put a smile on. My wife and I decided after the meal that we would really buckle down on eating out because there is no good reason to spend so much money for shitty service from shitty people with their shitty attitudes. My wife is a mean cook and I can cook too so I have no reason to spend my money outside unnecessarily. Oh and food was just ok, not terrible but not great either. #ShittyServiceNoTip (i'm gonna see if that catches on)",1.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"You know, after I made a res here, one of my friends from Florida mentioned they had one down there. And I should have known better the minute I found out this was a chain. But I went anyway, and it was horrible. Not a single thing I ate had any flavor. We got a BBQ duck flatbread that was just awful. Wasabi avocado ""mousse"" which was like someone stopped making guacamole after the first step. Not a hint of Wasabi or any other flavor for that matter. The paella was a joke. I guess they tried to make it deconstructed? It was a pile of bland rice at the center of the bowl, with again blandly steamed scallops, and then the worst part... Ugh, the lobster tail. Which they served WITH THE SH*T VEIN STILL IN IT. I'll post a pic. Just disgusting. They did bring me a new one which was still bland and awful and by the time I got it I just wanted to leave.

"Located next to Roosevelt field mall, adjacent to Houston's and next-door to The Capital Grille. This fine dining establishment has a lot of eats to offer. I've been here twice; first time with my family and better half, second time was just myself and my love. We returned with a $50 gift certificate that I received for Christmas. On my first visit it was nothing short of fabulous; the food was delicious and the customer service was on point. They do however ask you before you order if you're on a time limit. I guess that's to tell the chefs to move it along. Who knows I didn't ask why? Anyways! I ordered the Roasted Roma Tomato Flatbread- fresh mozzarella cheese Parmesan, ribbons of basil $9.89 Grilled Chicken Caprese Sandwich- fresh mozzarella,roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, sprouted-grain ciabatta $10.2 On my second visit I ordered The short rib flatbread- no longer on menu (See picture) Baby Kale Caesar Salad- shaved Parmesan cheese,roasted garlic ciabatta croutons $9 On my first visit, after our entrée our server came around with tray of desserts in cute little shot-size glasses. Each dessert was described to us and we each picked one out thinking ""oh, isn't that a sweet gesture free dessert."" Oh no it wasn't a sweet gesture on behalf of seasons 52; there was an additional charge for them when we reviewed our bill. So on my second visit when dessert came: Haha I was smarter this time, I already knew that there would be an additional charge; one dessert it was.  Either way everything was outstanding I will definitely be a repeat customer.",5.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"This place is crap. My wife and I were invited for dinner here by good friends. I originally said no to the place, since it sucked last time I came here, but we ended up coming anyway when we couldn't agree on an alternative. I don't remember much about last time, except that I was unimpressed with the options and equally by the food. Anyway, the service sucked today. It took 45 minutes to get an few lukewarm and flavorless appetizers, and another 45 minutes to get either flavorless or crap-flavored entrees. It also took three water requests to get water. I had the steak (not great, and the sides were terrible), the mac and cheese (best thing I tasted there) and the peppers (bland). I tried the tuna (which tasted like beef due presumably to being cooked in the same place), which came on some black rice that was horrendous, and the lamb (not great, although cooked well). Giving it a two instead of a one because the pricing isn't bad, the desserts are okay, and the place is nice, but it still blows overall.

I ordered the shrimp and grits entree and unfortunately was not impressed. There was a lot going on with this dish (bacon and sausage were too overpowering) and felt too muddled to really enjoy. I honestly make a better shrimp and grits dish at home. My husband had a fish entree which he enjoyed.

Happy Hour started at 4 so it was perfect timing! We ordered the crab cake and lobster flatbread to start. The crab cake was ok. However I did not like the flatbread. The flavors didn't mesh. The mustard over powered the delicate lobster. For our entree I ordered the shrimp and grits( the last place I had it botched it) so I was looking for redemption! My boyfriend ordered the salmon. My meal was pretty tasty except there were very little grits! There was a lot of sauce and the dish definitely needed more grits to soak it up. Hunny said his salmon was ok but not great. Although the waiter was nice service was a tad slow. We had to ask for waters which is bad for this caliber of restaurant. I don't know if it's me but I like to have a fresh glass when I order more wine and I didn't get that.

"It's a pass.  My first time here. And probably my last Went here for a corporate dinner.  It was a group of ten of us on a weekday night. 6 pm reservations. Had a table in the back room. Must have been a new waiter because service left plenty to be desired The apps that were ordered were a few different flat breads, nothing spectacular.  Your typical flat breads that you can get at any chain restaurant.  Also had that duck lollipops - drench is way too much sticky sweet sauce. Most people seems to order the rack of lamb and I did not hear any complaints.  I ordered the roast pork with a side of scallops.  Thank god I ordered that scallops, because the roast pork was dry and way over done.  The scallops were ok, but compared to the pork, they tasted fantastic (only when comparing to the pork) As far as the service, whenever the waiter brought a round of drinks to the table, he never took the empty glasses or bottles from the table.  By the time the entrees came to the table, the table was full of empty glasses, beer bottles, appetizer plates, etc.  It was quite a mess. And then the strangest thing I have ever seen in any restaurant happened - the dessert tower!!!   The waiter brought over a huge tower of mini desserts in shot glasses, probably 20 or 30 desserts on the towering rack.  The waiter took his time to describe to the table each and every variety on the rack.  Then the waiter put the rack on the table, took a photo of the table and the rack was passed from one end of the table to the other, with each dinner taking on dessert from the rack. When the tower and the remaining desserts got to the other end of the table, as each dinner was savoring their quite tasty creamy flavorful sweet item, the waiter grabbed the tower and the remaining 15 to 20 scrumptious items and disappeared!!!!  WTF!!! Was it supposed to be only 1 dessert per customer?  Are they going to resell the other desserts which had been passed from one end of the table to the other to other customers after they been handled.  Or was the staff going to eat the rest in the kitchen?   Very strange.",2.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"Oh, Seasons 52. I want to love you so bad, I'll trot out the Yelp ""I want to love you so bad"" cliche. I think that one of the reasons why I love (edit: like) Seasons 52 is because it's near my favorite restaurant ever, Houstons (CRY!!). Considering that all I get from Houstons these days is a bellyful of wistful sorrow, I'll seek relief at Seasons 52. If only. Seasons 52 has so much potential. Considering the experience that Darden Restaurants brings to the table (see what I did there?), Seasons 52 should nail it all the time. They don't. My disappointment in Seasons can be summarized in one word: Seasoning. Which is delicious irony, considering their name. Well, at least something's delicious, as pretty much every meal I've had at S52 has been woefully underseasoned. I was there there other night and had the lamb shank, which was expertly cooked, then ... not seasoned. Haricots verts came with the lamb - also no seasoning. My wife's chicken? Perfectly cooked, perfectly bare of seasoning. We made good use of the salt & pepper grinder on the table. As we had before. My wife observed that as a chain, Seasons needs to post its nutritional information, and they're not about to change their name to avoid that (good on you, Houston's/Hillstone!) So they might be holding back on the salt & fat to shine their numbers. Look, I'm at a restaurant to enjoy a nice meal - healthy calorie counts are cool and all, but not if your food makes me sad. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SALT THE FOOD! Pluses for the decor (sort of), large bar, good drinks (for a good price), and seasonal menu. Minuses for the seasoning.

"The Quick: Very trendy and romantic restaurant (all locations), great food and fun concept, all for under 475 calories per dish. Great chain that doesn't feel like a chain. The Details: The concept is unique and refreshing, they have four different main menus, one for each season, then they have different specials each week of the year... hence the 52, Seasons 52. I love that every time you go there's something new on the menu to be tried and devoured. They are also known for their extensive wine list, from average wines to an extremely high price point.  They really do have something to fit everyone's budget. It is a very sexy and appealing restaurant, perfect for a date or even for group. Every time I've gone I've tried something different, as the menu changes each week. Overall, every flatbread we have tried has been absolutely delicious. Very flavorful and crispy. The scallops were amazing, and the desserts are always the perfect portion of sweetness, served in big shot glasses. Just keep in mind since each dish has to be in the specified calorie range, they are normal human sized portions... So you'll want an appetizer to share. The only thing I didn't love was the duck lettuce wrap tacos (pictured). It was good but it honestly would have been better on a crispy panini with jam. I should have splurged for the duck sandwich  since each dish is still under 475 calories anyway. The Damage: A little pricey, since you have to get a flatbread/ appetizer to split (they're the best part!) We went for lunch with 5 people and spent $125 + tip for 5 entrees, 2 flatbreads, and one soup. There wasn't a lunch menu though, so we ordered regular priced entrees.

Overall service was a little hectic- we had what felt like 10 different waiters/waitresses come help us throughout the meal  - but our waiter told us this was not a typical Friday night (there was a concert later that night). They had live music (covers of popular songs) which I appreciate so set a nice mood. I got the prosciutto flatbread which I LOVED... and the goat cheese ravioli which was good but I wasn't thrilled with the sauce.

"I'll do the price 1st, $22 for pork tenderloin and can't remember shrimp and grits (prb 19).   The food is tastey but portioned.  We were still hungry after eating appetizers and entrées.  The flat bread Pizza is amazing but again super ""flat"".lol.  The pork tenderloin with vegetables and mashed yams was great, just not a fan of Yams.  It comes with 3 or 4 little pieces, would love more meat. It's a good place but don't expect to be stuffed.  The baked chicken comes with the most meat, should've ordered that.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
This place is very easy to find due to the signage out near old country road by the entrance to The Roosevelt Field Mall. Once your pull up you have the very courteous and friendly Ameripark Valet Service. Once you go inside the decor is wonderful and the atmosphere is good. The only thing is there are kids in this place that are pretty loud so just be ready for that and you'll be okay. I had made a reservation but we did have to wait as they were running behind but I did get a tiny compensation for it. Not the exact compensation I was looking for like a drink at the bar but a free flatbread then next time I come a clever idea to get to come back soon. Once seated the server was very polite and enthusiastic. The drinks and food once ordered did take a while to get to the table but once arrived we're pretty good. I did have to try more than one wine to get a good one. The mixed drinks came out right the first time. The food was not as hot as I'd like it maybe because I had to wait for I knife to eat it for awhile. It was good nothing too special but I was healthy. As for desert they do have a full bars which is good if you like a good desert cocktail like I do with my indulgence. They could really use a desert shake up I'm getting board of the same desert shooters maybe mix it up soon.,4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
Solid 3.5 stars.  I kind of expected to be disappointed given its location in the mall but pleasantly surprised.  This place serves a seasonal menu based on what is available locally.  The majority of items are seafood based but that's a good thing. The lobster flatbread was really tasty and a great meal starter.  Cedar plank salmon was good and the side of heirloom carrots was also tasty.  Portions are a bit smaller than other large chain restaurants but its in line with its healthy vibe.  Good choice if you want something a bit healthier but be prepared to pay a bit more for it.,3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Came here today with my cousin and friend for lunch after a mini girl's day. We were seated pretty quickly and the front staff was very pleasant and amicable. We were famished and quickly decided on our meals items. I ordered a glass of wine but they were out and our attentive server brought a different kind of red for me to try. When I decided it was good, he filled the glass again and apologized for not having the other wine that I was interested in. Myself and my girlfriend, each decided to get the Ahi Tuna Tartare to start. The presentation was wonderful. It consisted of avocado, diced fruit and tuna. The flavor was really nice but the prep on the tuna was not good. They left membranes all throughout, causing an unappealing texture. It got to the point where I had to send it back. My friend's dish was prepared the same but she decided to eat what she could. Our server was very understanding. He knew exactly what I was talking about in regards to my meal. He took back my plate and sent over a manager. They both asked if I wanted something else or a new plate of the same thing. They were really trying to make it right so, I can't get completely upset. I just get frustrated when I receive dishes like that. It really should have never left the kitchen. For our mains, I went for the Warm Mushroom & Arugula Salad. My friend had the Salmon Salad and my cousin had the Signature Burger. The food that I could actually eat was decent. My salad was different and tasty, my cuz liked her burger (but, I don't know how because she ordered it medium-well :o( Boo). One dish can spoil a meal and your perspective of an encounter, but the way an employee can make a patron feel while they are visiting an establishment is able to change that perspective and can turn an entire experience around.

It was a bit burned on the outside and totally dry and chewy on the inside. How do you dry out dark meat???  I switched out the Yukon mash for the risotto. The risotto was like cement and probably microwaved. I should have sent it back and ordered something else, foolish me. Additionally, the bread was nothing special and yet they had the nerve to charge extra if you want more than one piece per person. Also, it should be noted that the flatbread appetizer we ordered was pretty much tasteless. In all fairness, the staff was very attentive, the food presentation was pretty and my side salad was delicious.  The desserts looked good too, but it made me laugh when they brought them over and presented them using a flashlight.

"Wow. I haven't been here in over two years and was looking forward to eating here again. I liked the way they used spices, in place of oil, to give their dishes taste, but without all the fat. I know it had been purchased by a large corporate chain, so I was already kinda expecting some decline in quality. I never expected what I got. First off, they did away with the piano player, which added some class and ambiance to the place. Next, I noticed my favorite appetizer, the tuna roll, had been taken off the menu. Two stikes already. I ordered what I thought was close enough to this dish, the tuna tarter appetizer. I never knew raw tuna could taste so bland. If it wasn't for the avovaco, this dish would have zero taste. Next up, the filet mignon, which I had ordered many times from here in the past. The meat was tasty, but it wasn't a meaty taste as much as it was a salty taste. Kinda like a cheesburger from a fast food chain. Tasty, but you know where the taste is coming from. As for the vegetable and mashed potatoes that came with the dish, they were as bland as could be. It was as if the new cooks, and I assume they were not the same cooks, had forgotten how to use spices. I should have expected a significant decline in quality though, as publicly traded restaurant corporations focus on profit growth much more than than they do food quality. But this was extreme. And even the clientele was noticeably different. Where as before the customers looked like they knew their way around a menu, these customers looked more like a Red Lobster crowd. Oh, what a difference a corporate buyout makes!",1.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

In addition, the vast menu option ensures that there's a meal that works for everyone. But, you can't end a birthday celebration without dessert. They have the best desserts inside these glass tubes.

"It's health food and I liked it, holy crap. So the menu changes with the season, it's a nice take on what's in season. It's also interesting because everything on the menu is under 475 calories, it kinda shocked me that everything on the menu was under 500 calories. My only gripe would be the food, as a whole, was on the under seasoned side. The decor is nice, and semi high class but there is definitely an older crowd and for some reason, the decor really felt like a Houston's to me. The food: Hummus duo with crisp Hawaiian Sea Salt Lavosh- minted edamame hummus, roasted red pepper hummus. The hummus was OK, I did like the edamame one better. The lavosh was OK but it really wasn't much of a factor. The thing that bugged me a lot was how cold the hummus was, it was off puttingly cold. yelp.com/user_local_phot… Cedar-plank roasted Salmon- roasted vegetables & crushed potatoes, dill-mustard sauce, grilled lemon. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this dish especially since I am usually not the biggest fan of cooked salmon. The salmon was good but it was slightly overcooked. The roasted veg were great, the crushed potato was kinda odd for me. It just seemed like a boiled potato someone stepped on lol The grilled lemon was a nice addition to the salmon as was the dill-mustard. yelp.com/user_local_phot… Side of caramelized sea scallops- I was just so so with the scallops.

"Update: Spoke to the managing partner at Seasons 52 (Nicholas) and had a productive conversation with him. I expressed my concerns about the service and he addressed each one. He even took the time to find out who my server was even though I didn't mention her name in my review (or want to get her into trouble). That really impressed me that they took the effort to look for that information. This has renewed my faith in this establishment and I'm willing to give them another chance (plus the food is really good) Original Review: I've come to Season's 52 multiple times over the past year and I have never left disappointed. However, this Thanksgiving, I am leaving it with thoughts of never coming back. If I rated this place before today, it would have gotten 5 stars. Instead, after one night, I'm giving it 3 stars. My reasons: 1. Was seated at the table with no menus. 2. After the server came over, she asked if we had menus and I said no. It took about 5 minutes to get it. 3. After ordering food and drinks, got my drink order wrong. 4. The appetizer order didn't come as expected, but apparently the restaurant changed how they prepare it. 5. We never got plates for the appetizers and had to eat over napkins (even though we were told plates would be coming) 6. We ordered the turkey dinners and when we noticed other tables were getting cornbread, we figured it would be given to us. However, when we asked the waitress, she said it's given upon request. Thanks for letting us know. When we got the bread, it wasn't presented on a dish like everyone else. 7. Never asked if we wanted refills on drinks (but kind of asked if we wanted anything at random times when she was around) 8. The server's saving grace was she boxed our leftovers. In the end, what made it worse was there was another server working in the same section and service was almost day vs night. There were too many ways to compare service. Final insult to injury? Given the take home container with no bag. I didn't know if they ran out or what, but when I saw someone else have one, I asked and got one from another server.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"We must have hit a bad night. Things ranged from poor to worse. 4 out of 5 orders were cold or over-cooked. Getting served was problematic. Specific requests such as ""no sugar in the cocktail"" were overlooked. Waitress often hard to find when needed. Extremely long wait for main dishes, which kept us from sending problem dishes back. The one good dish was the flatbread appetizer.  And by the way, why do so many places think people want lemon in their glass of water?  Especially when one has to request water to get some. Perfect opportunity to find out if lemon is desired, right. The room was incredibly noisy due to a combination of the crowd size and the all-hard-surfaces decor. The men's room was not being kept neat; used towels and puddles were all over the sink. If this were a diner, I would not be so critical, but at $45-50 a head I expect much better. I spoke to the manager about all this on the way out and he was very apologetic, providing $50 in coupons for ""next time."" My wife immediately said there would not be a next time. Well, I decided I might as well use the coupon when I happened to need the Apple Store at Roosevelt Field. By itself, this visit might have been worth 2 stars. Noise level ok, waitress ok, most food (just) ok, but my steak was quite overdone, even though they make point of telling you how medium rare will look. They delivered medium well.

The manager REFUSED to come out and told the waiter to take the coffee off the bill as compensation and give us free dessert ( as if we would continue to eat anything after this...) we weren't mad at the waiter, we were just upset at how the manager handled the whole thing. It was very insulting that the manager didn't think it was important to come out when a customer asks for him, especially after an incident like this. And he thought it was enough to simply take the coffee charge off the bill. It wasn't the money, it was the principle of the matter. My mom requests to speak to him again and he finally comes out.

Hard to believe, given the size of my sushi grade salmon salad entrée, that it was about 350 calories. That, along with a 290 calorie potato leek soup, plus a beer, was enough to satisfy me for dinner. Pretty remarkable, given how easy it is to get fat while eating out. I thought the food was fresh and delicious, creative and modern. Jess got an appetizer Greek salad and the filet mignon, both were superb. Really hard to believe that she only had 420 calories on her plate. But they stay away from dumping tons of carbs and dairy in their dishes and I guess if you do that, you can keep calories in check. We will go back but I don't know if we'll go again on a Saturday, given their poor handling of the crowds.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was pretty slow. When I walked in the hostess greeted me and asked for my name. Then I waited about 5 minutes before they sat me behind a rowdy bunch. I ordered the lobster flatbread as the appetizer,which was great. I forgot the name of the cocktail but I believe it was something with lemonade in it, I didn't enjoy it. For my entree I chose the vegetarian sampler and it was not good at all. My friend ordered the herb roasted chicken and she said it was ok. Also, I asked for an iced tea and never received it.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"The place has nice decor. I ordered one of the ""up and coming wines that will be famous"" , a tempranillo, but it was bad (like fungus, opened 3 days ago in a hot room bad) so I ordered a Kim Crawford Pinot Noir which was fresh. The food is decent, but not great here. The lobster flat bread was ok. I ordered the Rainbow Trout which was quite good. It was perfectly filleted,  but slightly overcooked.  The filet mignon and chicken were not as tasty as they could have been. The Caramalized Sea Scallops were tasty. The motif of the place is seasonal dishes. The food is like what one gets from a wedding country club, but not as good as the Crest Hollow.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"Came for a business dinner and it was okay. We had a group of 60 or so people split up between 7 tables I believe. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and put upstairs in a private dining area, which I liked. We had a semi-set menu. Apps: At each table there were 2 different kinds of flatbreads (two of each): the roasted roma tomato (tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, parmesan) and the garlic pesto chicken (chicken, pesto, arugula, red peppers, balsamic onions, mozzarella). They both kinda tasted like a frozen pizza that you would get frozen from Trader Joe's and think was really good for a frozen pizza from Trader Joe's. In other words, they were tasty, but not when considering the price point and ""fanciness"" of the restaurant. I thought the roasted roma tomato was better because the pesto on the other didn't taste entirely fresh. They also had a large salad out for us (the organic field greens- cucumbers, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, white balsamic vinaigrette) which I thought was totally fine, but again, I wasn't exactly wowed. Between the four flatbreads and the huge salad there were way too many appetizers for my table of 7 people to finish. Probably at least half the salad and more than half of the flatbreads went to waste :( Mains: We had a choice between the vegetarian option (some vegetable tasting), the cedar plank grilled salmon (with potatoes), and the half chicken (along with asparagus, and mashed potatoes, au jus). I ordered the half chicken and some others at my table ordered the salmon. I didn't get to see the vegetarian option so I can't comment on it. My chicken came with two large pieces, one white and one dark. I actually thought my dish was really, really good. The potatoes were buttery and flavorful and the asparagus tasted fresh, although I would have preferred it a little crispier. The chicken was pretty good, although I thought the white meat was just a little dry. I didn't try the salmon, but it looked okay. Two things that were really off-putting were that the server didn't ask how people wanted their salmon cooked. Salmon, in my opinion, should be cooked to order. From what I could tell it looked like it was done medium well, which is a little over what I prefer. Also, the plating was irregular and sloppy with the salmon. One of my coworkers got a lemon and the rest didn't, which was strange. I understand things are tough with big groups but the expo should really be checking for stuff missing from plates. Dessert: We had a selection of little desserts in glasses. I tried the pecan pie, which was SO GOOD. They all looked beautiful, too. I also liked how they were tiny, just giving a little sweet taste at the end rather than being some super decadent and rich dessert. My review really falls apart at the service, which was just sloppy and unprofessional. The servers did not wait for everyone to arrive before they started taking orders. One of the managers at my table arrived just a few minutes late and he had barely sat down when the server ran over and rushed him to decide what he wanted. Not surprisingly, seat numbers were all messed up and there was some confusion at my table and the person to my right was entree-less until we alerted the server. They just totally skipped him. Service was also a little slow with refilling waters. Hopefully, the poor service was just a reflection of people getting flustered at a large party. That being said, there were some mistakes that are inexcusable. I would't go out of my way to return, but if I had plans with a friend who wanted to go there, I wouldn't necessarily dread my evening, either.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"I came here for a reunion with a group of friends.  I got the vegetarian tacos (minus the cheese), they were ok, but not really seasoned well to be tasty. My fiance also ordered off the vegan menu and got the cedar plank roasted tofu with potatoes and spinach, I tried some and the tofu had a nice smokey taste to it, but I still would have liked more seasoning.. my other complaint is that their special menus (vegan, lactose-free, gluten-free) don't have prices listed on them, so we had to ask our server. Most of the things on the vegan menu ended up being cheaper than things on the normal menu which was a plus, but we still had to pay the same price for a flat-bread we ordered without cheese, it would've been nice if their menu would allow for subbing more veggies in place of cheese while not charging us more (though to be fair we didn't ask our server about this). I probably wouldn't choose to come back here on my own (though I would go with a group). I really appreciate that they have a vegan menu but they need to improve what's on it.",3.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52
"The worst $80 for 2 ever spent. The server, Paulina, clearly didn't want to serve us and delayed taking our order until we finally flagged down the manager, Nick, who was very kind. We ordered spinach, which literally looked like it came directly from a bag. She lied about how was cooked and literally snatched it off the table to take it back to the kitchen. As she walked back to the kitchen she rolled her eyes and muttered. I stopped her to ask why was she acting like this, then she lied again and said she didn't do any of that. I expressed my displeasure to Nick, who remade the spinach and gave us a gift card. Frankly, I will never return. The tasteless, cold, small portioned, hard food plus the service were abysmal. I have no idea how this chain lasts.",1.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"We have been here once before and the food was good, but this time is was off a bit. My dining partner ordered the crab cake sandwich and they bought out a plate so hot that the cold items on it were affected, such as the lettuce which wilted and the mayo based sauce. I guess they had it under the heating lamp too long while waiting for my dish to be prepared. She sent it back and had the lobster flatbread which was tasty. I ordered the scallops with butternut squash & leek risotto. The scallops were cooked perfect, but there was very little risotto on the plate AND there was grit from the leeks in the risotto which means the leeks were not cleaned properly before preparing.

Dinner was another experience altogether: the service was bad, from the hostess to the waiter to the manager. A friend and I had a reservation for this past Saturday night, 8 PM. We arrived at 7:55; the hostess said that it would be about ten minutes; I asked her if we should sit at the bar (I was polite; I get it, sometimes things get busy, I just wanted to enjoy my time). She jerked her head at me and barked ""Go to the bar!"" We did, and then we were seated as soon as we ordered drinks. Ok. As soon as we sat, the waiter appeared and said, ""Can I take your order?"" We had literally just sat down. Several minutes later, things appear to be settling down, and he takes our order at a more normal time. We decided to share a flatbread, and my friend got a salad. I ordered the filet mignon, very rare, and my friend got the rainbow trout. She got stuffed mushrooms as a side. We're having a good time, talking, the apps come out, they're good, great, great, great. About five minutes after the apps come out, so do our entrees. Delivered by the manager. She's smiling, I say that this is quick, there's a lot of food on the table, and our apps just came out. No acknowledgement other than, ""Oh?"" She smilingly walks away. I'm glad she was having such a happy night. So now we have a tableful of food. The waiter comes by a minute later, ""How is everything?"" I tell him, this was fast. There's a lot of food here, and we feel rushed. ""No! Take your time! You ordered your steak rare, so it was ready!"" I say, that's a timing issue on your part; people order steaks to different temperatures, most restaurants get this right. ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry."" And he walks away. He apologized a bunch of times, but at the end of the night he took off the stuffed mushrooms (? So weird. Pay for our drinks or something? Why the stuffed mushrooms?) from the bill, but I'm over this place. Seasons 52 has good food, but at $70 for my half of the bill, I'm paying for service as much as I'm paying for good food, and I didn't get it. One final note: We were seated in a booth near the service end of the bar (for servers to pick up drinks for their tables). At one point, a waitress was over there complaining to her manager about her table; it was loud enough for me to hear, and it was a pretty obnoxious thing to do in front of other tables; what exactly is Seasons 52 doing in their training for servers and staff? Rush the guests, ignore them when they speak up, and complain loudly about them (I mean in general, this was not my server, and she wasn't complaining about my table) in front of other tables? I'll tell you one thing, I'll miss Houston's when it's gone. For the record, lunch was better. Get your shopping done early and go for lunch. Don't go here unless you're going to the mall though; this is NOT a worthy restaurant destination in and of itself.",2.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"Seasons 52 has a menu that changes with each season. So expect fresh ingredients and what's in season. According to the website is described as a casual and sophisticated setting and I agree. It's a fairly large restaurant. There is a large bar and sometimes they have a musician performing live in the bar area. It's good for groups and its also good for intimate settings because the restaurant has separated the rooms nicely. The service was very good, waiters attentive. We ordered filet mignon and sea scallops. Both were cooked nicely. Flavor was on point and ingredients tasted fresh. Dessert was interesting. The bring you an arms length display of 8 desserts ask at once and they make you feel like you want all of them. Though you very well could, you'd pay for each one separately.

There was a good amount of lobster bits and I believe some scallion on it.  The flat bread was thin and crispy.  For entree I got the Lobster Pappardelle.  It came with pasta, lobster tail and some vegetable.  The lobster tail was flavorful and it also came with bits of lobster pieces with the pasta.  I would recommend this dish to anyone who is going here.

"A very perfect birthday dinner for a dear friend: I called ahead and told the hostess that it was my friend's birthday and asked if I could pre-order a dessert with a candle -- but sans the every-waiter-in-the-place-singing-hbd bit. She said: ""Oh! I will tell your server it's her birthday and we'll take care of everything."" And take care of everything they did! A cute mason jar full of flowers along with a hand-written ""Happy Birthday"" card with a personalized message for her from Seasons staff was waiting on the table when we arrived. We quickly ordered cocktails and then they also brought over an amuse bouche, which was quite tasty, along with two complimentary flutes of champagne. Another nice touch! We first ordered the shrimp cocktail, but was told by our server she thought they had taken it off the menu, but it was still printed there. She came back and informed us it was no longer offered, so we ordered the tuna/avocado sushi roll for an appetizer. It had a really nice flavor but had that non-sushi restaurant rice around it--the kind of thick-walled super-sticky rice. It's not my favorite, but it was good (I'm a sushi snob and yes, I criticize the sushi rice). I ordered the sea scallops, which came with a butternut squash risotto and broccolini. With every entree being under 500 calories, I can understand why there was so little of the risotto but I totally wanted more! It was very tasty. The broccolini? Not so much. It had zero seasoning and was very undercooked. I fixed it up with some squeezed lemon and it was okay. The scallops themselves were good, but tasted possibly frozen. They didn't have that fresh-from-the-sea salt water taste to them, which is usually lost when they're frozen. But for about $24, it was good and filling. ((and 500 cals)) My friend got the trout, which she devoured. She kept saying how much she was enjoying it -- and she's Caribbean -- so she knows her fish! Whatever sauce came on the side with it ((I tried a bit on my scallops)) was divine. And as if the handwritten card, flowers, amuse bouche and champagne weren't enough, they brought a ""celebration tower"" over to us -- a nicely tiered tray of their shot glass desserts -- with the top shot glass a candle. They had a ridiculous amount of desserts to choose from -- all just a few, scrumptious bites shoved into a shot glass -- including s'mores, cannoli, carrot cake, chocolate peanut butter, pecan pie, etc. We had the s'mores and cannoli and both were great -- and comp'ed! The manager and waitress made sure our dining experience was wonderful and that my friend really felt extra special on her birthday. I've never seen a restaurant go so above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed and appreciated for choosing their restaurant to celebrate their birthday at. Oh-- and their valet service is great. Very quick and friendly and a nice touch ((parking at this mall can be impossible)). So bravo! Seasons 52, for bringing health and happiness to your customers.

Who does that?! Why didn't they know this prior to seating us there? Furthermore, why couldn't the party who hadn't even arrived yet be seated at a different table? Nobody knows! They offered appetizers and a round of drinks as service recovery, but the situation really wasn't handled well.  Even the waiter seemed confused as to why we were being moved.

I was little surprise that my spring vegetables is just frozen peas and carrots, for a restaurant which emphasize fresh ingredients I was expecting at least some fresh squash.. My husband's lobster pappardelle was pretty dry with no sauce although well seasoned.  I guess its a trade off for the lower calories.

I got the lobster tail and arugula salad for my main course. Tuna tartare w/ guacamole - what's not to love the tuna was perfectly paired with the guacamole.The chips were on the salty side.

"I'd treat this place like a tapas place for the best experience. Portions are definitely smaller so you'll want at least one app. For about $30 to $40 a person you will have a great meal.

We loved how the waiters were honest about what was and wasn't good on the menu. They were super attentive and made sure we were good every step of the way. First we had the garlic pesto chicken flat bread and chipolate shrimp flat bread. Both were about $10 and a foot long. Totally delicious and two made a good portion. I'd definitely recommend these for an app...they come out in only a few minutes. Then we had the Shrimp Cavatappi Pasta which was excellent for $20. The sauce really made it... And typically I will never write home about any pasta dish. After our apps it was a good portion for sharing. Only downside is that this took much longer than it should to come to our table. We tried a side of potato wedges with truffle mayo. They were alright... A bit forgettable. Last were the dessert cups for $2.75 each. They were little shot glasses filled with pies. We had almost all of them (6 total) and highly recommend the Peanut Butter mousse, Tropical Cheesecake, and Raspberry Can noli. The bill came to $68 after tax for two people without drinks.

My friend got the chicken and it looked crazy good too.  Moist and flavorful all throughout. When we decided to get dessert, the waiter came with a full tray to pick from and described each and every one.  I got the key lime pie and quickly finished it.  It was sweet, tangy and the perfect combination of tart.  There are so many to choose from so if you like an extremely chocolately dessert, they have that too!

The decor is pretty typical American restaurant style. Tables and chairs were of dark wood as well as the booths. There was bar seating as well. The kitchen was open so you could see the chefs cooking. Our waitress, Lisa, took our order for drinks. My partner ordered the Meyer lemonade. He liked it very much and ordered a second glass during the course of our dinner. I ordered the Hawaiian Pineapple Cosmopolitan, which poured out into two glass-full. It was semi-sweet and light. Perfect. For appetizers, we shared the Kobacha Squash Ravioli and the Lump Crab, Roasted Shrimp & Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. They were both decent. The ravioli was light but the stuffed mushrooms were a little more salty than I prefer. Also, the taste of the crab, shrimp, spinach, and mushrooms did not really mesh. They were individually tasted as you ate them. My partner ordered the Caramelized Grilled Sea Scallops, which came with butternut squash risotto and broccolini. I didn't taste the broccolini but the scallops were alright. I've had better but they were by no means bad at all. The risotto tasted awesome; it was cooked perfectly with a hint of squash-taste. Yum! I asked Lisa for recommendations since I wanted the scallops too but didn't want to order the same dish. Excited to express her recommendation, aside from the scallops, she said she surprisingly enjoyed the Southern Style Shrimp & Grits. She also recommended the Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout, the Maui Tuna Crunch Salad and the Sesame Grilled Salmon Salad, but the grits really jumped at me since she was pretty enthusiastic about it. I'm glad I listened to her. Shrimp, chorizo, bacon, and cheese grits. What's not to love? For dessert, they come in double-shot glasses. We got the peanut butter mousse and pumpkin pie. They were both decadent and perfectly sized so you don't feel so guilty. Overall, the food was decent and the service was great. The price was not too expensive. The location could be better. Our waitress, Lisa, made out experience great. Would I come back? Sure, but probably not during peak hours as I'm sure it would get pretty crowded.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

"We came here on a Saturday night for my MILs birthday dinner. First off, my FIL made a reservation and specifically told them it was his wife's birthday. When we sat down the hostess gave a birthday card from the restaurant. When our desserts came out, there was no candle or anything in the shooters. I just thought to myself that maybe they don't do this sort of thing but I saw at not one but TWO tables on the way out they had a candle in their shooter. You would think at a restaurant trying to be more high end that the front would communicate with the wait staff to tell them it's a birthday. Also, and this completely irked me, when we were done eating our food they didn't clear the plates right away. We were clearly finished, we stacked them! And our waiter walked by at least 5 times and never took them off of our table. Actually we had to ask another waiter to either remove them for us or send someone over to do so. Again, at a restaurant that is trying to be more high end, the finished plates should be clearly immediately. Not 15 minutes after we have finished the food. The service honestly was the worst service I've seen a restaurant in a very very long time. The manager must have had friends come eat there that night because the same bald guy kept going over to one table to check on them. He should really be keeping an eye on the rest of the restaurant and the people who haven't had their water glass filled after sitting around with empty glasses. My husband and I go out to eat A LOT and we would never return to this establishment. On a side note, the food was pretty gross.

However, I was quite disappointed on my last trip here a couple of months ago. I got a shrimp dish that was on their brand new summer menu, that came with saffron-flavored risotto. Well, this risotto was essentially mushy rice. It was not the properly made risotto you should find (and I've had well-done risotto before). It tasted nothing of saffron and tasted very tart. It was barely edible. The shrimp was rubbery. The dish was a Gordon Ramsay nightmare. I don't think I'll return soon.",2.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

We had the fish tacos, the duck lettuce wraps, the bahn-mi sandwich, a really good pepper appetizer, and the tamale bites. We enjoyed everything we ordered and with their early stuff at the end.

"The concept behind the restaurant is for the core of the menu to change each season, for there to be weekly specials, and for each item on the menu to be under 475 calories. Given this, I'll try to focus on the experience rather than the food (because the item I order is not supposed to be on the menu in a week). We were told the wait was 45 minutes which is not an absurd wait time, but we became very frustrated when we saw several open tables while waiting. The hostesses need to seat patrons more efficiently. Fortunately, this was my only complaint regarding service. Once we were seated, the service was excellent! Our waitress Skye was patient, accommodating, and knowledgeable on the menu. I will certainly request to be seated in her section if I return. The decor is modern and the restaurant is dimly lit. I'm not an expert on decor or ambiance, but I suppose this place would qualify as trendy. For appetizer, we shared the grilled chicken pesto flatbread and the lobster and shrimp spring rolls. The flatbreads seem to be a mainstay specialty on the menu, so I'd suggest trying one. The springs rolls were too cold; they should have sat a room temperature a little longer so that taste of the shellfish would have been more imminent. My spring roll also fell apart, but that may have been my fault for improperly handling the spring roll. In sum, the spring rolls were good; however, they were not an item I'd order again if they reappeared on the menu. For main course, I ordered the Manchester Farms Quail. For those unfamiliar with quail (as I was before this dinner), it tastes similar to chicken and turkey. It was stuffed with mushroom risotto and served over a bed of sauteed spinach and bacon with a balsamic vinaigrette glaze. It was delicious, and I would recommend it if ever reappears on the menu.",4.0,"630 Old Country Rd, Ste Ll02, Garden City, NY 11530",Seasons 52

Lobster and mozzarella flatbread was recommended by staff, it was only okay, I would pass on it next time.  Chilled lobster and shrimp spring roll, neither one of us liked it, sent back, pass on this. And for me not to love anything with lobster just plain bothers me, but it just wasn't there. Caramelized grill sea scallops were amazing, definitely try. Cedar plank roasted salmon and vegetables were amazing. I really enjoyed both of these, and they healthy options which made them even better. Then I got frisky because I haven't had drinks or desert in a while. Mojitos were made perfect. Then they come around with the desert tray, it's actually normal servings around 300 calories, not enormous Cheesecake Factory portions with 2000 calories. Pecan pie with vanilla mouse amazing really did it for me, just great, but the Chocolate peanut butter mousse was only okay.

"Seasons 52? More like unseasoned 52. While there are many things I appreciate about this place (vegan menu, everything is under 475 calories, etc.), it really really fails to deliver on flavor. I started with a Fuji Apple Slaw. It was unfortunately swimming in vinaigrette. You could tell the vinaigrette did not have a balance of oil and vinegar and ended up being super sharp in an unpleasant way. I'm so confused why they wouldn't have plated that slaw with a slotted spoon to let all that dressing out. It was really disappointing. I attached a picture so you could see the liquid it was swimming in. For my main course I got the Vegetarian Tacos off the vegan menu. It was much more like fajitas. The green salsa just tasted like pureed tomatillos and the red salsa tasted like tomato sauce. So upsettingly bland. Not everything was a miss! The service is very attentive and fairly warm, which is definitely nice. I love the decor and feel. A nice upscale casual place. But the bottom line is that I come to eat, not sit in a pretty place.

We started with the mushroom, spinach, shrimp starter, we noticed it was taking a bit long, but our waiter kept us in the loop. Told us that the chef had to remake the dish because the mushrooms got burned. I completely appreciate when a restaurant tells you the issue. I would rather they remake a dish to bring me a better product then serve me subpar meal. Another restaurant, might have just sent it out anyways. I was perfectly fine waiting a bit a longer as we had great drinks already, but he did offer us a soup at no charge to start. We opted to wait and later in the meal the manager came by and said the app and desserts were on them. Simply fantastic, uncalled for but greatly appreciated. The shrimp mushroom starter was delicious and came out piping hot. I will say I wanted some sort of aioli or creme or foam on top to tie it all together. We ordered a flat bread which is an excellent go to. Along with the meatloaf which had perfectly burnt ends just how I like it and the middle was flavorful with sweet BBQ sauce. I'm not too into green beans, but when seasoned correctly they are crispy, light and disappeared. The dessert cups are so good. It's the perfect closer. Get the pecan one, ludicrously delicious.

I got the wild alaska salmon with risotto and vegetables. The salmon barely had any seasoning and for a wild alaka salmon, it tasted quite bland.

"More of a 3.5 ish?? But Ehhhh I really want to like this place but the last time I went I felt like the food here really fell flat. My family had the tomato flatbread and the hummus plate, which was fine, nothing that outstanding. For our entrees, they were pretty hit or miss. I had the Nantucket scallops which were pretty good, the lemon ricotta ravioli was super tasty but there were only 2 so most of my dish was arugula :( my brother liked the meatloaf that he had. My dad said that his filet mignon was ""so-so"" and he was mildly frustrated that he had to put in so much effort into cutting the broccolini into edible pieces. My mom was pretty disappointed in the half chicken that she ordered- there was really no flavor beyond the skin and the white meat was realllllllly dry. She said that the Costco rotisserie chicken we had the day before was better, and that only costs $4.99 for the whole chicken. Drinks were pretty good though- I had the Meyer lemonade and it was strong and refreshing. They have a decent selection of wines and beers. Service here is cordial and attentive. Ambiance is good, tables are a touch crowded but it's fine. The music sometimes comes from a live piano player/singer at the bar which is cool. So overall, nothing that bad. The food just falls flat for the price (~$10/app, $20-$30/entree). However I did see this happy hour being advertised for $15 for two glasses of wine and a flatbread and I'd be curious to try that at some point.",3.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"Went here because a relative gave us a gift card that included this chain.  When we came into the restaurant, we loved the ambiance.  Nice.  Got seated right away.  Initially the service was good.  We decided and ordered on our appetizer fairly quickly, Duck Leg Lollipops.  Spent a few more minutes deciding on what to order for main course.   Finally decided on Boneless Short Ribs and Lamb Loin.  The waiter was over pretty quickly.  So far, so good.  Loved it so far. They bought the appetizer out.  The duck legs were meaty, the sauce was very spicy and very sweet.  I liked it, but I wondered, since the menyu didn't say it was spicy, and the waiter did not mention it, how would people who don't spicy react??  Anyway, this was the high point of the meal, we had high expectations now. Food & Service was downhill fast.  The bought out the entrees before we were close to finishing our appetizer.  We felt rushed to eat our appetizers.  Waiter was barely around (possibly due to a large table he was also waiting on).  We had to hunt for more water. The short Ribs were very tender, but for the money, a bit bland.  The leg of lamb was gamey and overcooked.  The waiter asked how i want it done.  I then asked him what is recommended, though I usually ask for Medium rare.  He said medium is recommended.  I think it may have been tastier if it was medium rare, I have to listen to my gut next time.  Waiter probably confused most recommended for being most popular??? Then when we were done and looking for the check and to have food wrapped up, could not find our waiter again.  Finally found him, asked for the check and to pack up the leftovers.  He said he'll bring out a couple of boxes.  He came back with them and in a rather uncaring, sloppy way, dumped each of our dishes into the containers using our dirty forks.  If you are going to pack leftovers in front of people, do it in a respectful way, neat, make it nice.  Care for your job. Then we gave our credit cards, that took awhile to get done, but not too horrible. Anyway, I will not come back here.  For the high price (BTW this is not a $$, really is $$$), a little more care into the food and service would help immensely!!!",2.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"Ended up back here again (unfortunately) for dinner a month or so ago, simply because it's mid-way for me & family to meet. Another below average experience. Our server was a polite guy, but very inefficient & inexperienced. We ordered a bottle of wine, he had no clue of the basics of serving it. Was in a hurry to rush off instead of listening to everyone's orders. Would disappear for long gaps of time & not check back for drink/water refills etc or if the right food had made its way to our table and we were ok. We constantly had to flag down whichever server passed us to ask for stuff. 3 out of 4 salads/appetizers made it out, he (or the kitchen) forgot about the 4th. When we finally said something, the manager came by to apologize and comped something off the menu. OK - but that is a 'short term' solution, trying to pacify the customer by giving them something for free. I mean really, if I can drop $70+ pp without batting an eye, your $12 comp does me no good (I'm not one of those customers who just complains to get free stuff). Because it doesn't take away from the fact that my whole dining experience was tarnished due to bad service. Management needs to address the main issue i.e. young, inexperienced staff that needs training! While the food at this place has always been mediocre at best, the ambiance etc tries to up the price point. Not worth it.

It just felt like it was missing that extra ""pizzazz"". The consensus from most of us that the was that the food was slightly underwhelming - certainly nothing we would drive out of our way for. However, I will say that for a little under $10, I wasn't terribly upset about it. At the end of the our dinner, we were presented with the little dessert cups, which were $3 a pop. I had a s'mores one, and I liked it even more than the meal. I also have to give props to the staff. They were super accommodating and kind.

My wife had the Crispy braised short ribs sandwich, that was served on a crispy flat bread, which was the perfect touch. The Deviled eggs were pretty good too, but could use a pinch of salt. They were actually pickled pink for breast cancer awareness month. I also had their Duck wing lollipops, which were tasty with a nice kick of spice. The Cider glazed chicken skewers were also very on point, the home made slaw was very good.

This may be because there was a musician playing in the middle of the bar. So people were probably talking louder than usual. We were sat in the back corner which was nice because we were away from most of the noise, but also not great because we were easily forgotten by our waitress.

The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly but neither of us enjoyed the balsamic drizzle on top. It seemed to be very low grade and extremely suite.

"I want to Seasons 52 for my girlfriend Shannon's birthday and I have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype that I heard about it. One thing that I've always noticed about Seasons 52 is that they're always cars in the parking lot and I've always heard very good things about the food from people who have dined there in the past. When we walked in, the restaurant looked very fancy but not so much that we would feel out of place or that you might feel like I need to be super rich to go there. we noticed off to the side that there was a wine bar where there was a man playing a piano, a nice touch to an upscale place. When we sat down at the table we looked over both the food and drink menu and he first thing that we noticed is that they change their menu with the seasons (hence the name). This is a concept that I have to say I love because a lot of restaurants seem to be afraid to make major changes to the menu because they live by the philosophy ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" To an extend I agree with that because if something is making you money you don't want to change it around and risk losing your income. In the other hand you want to keep you patrons coming back and experiencing something new when they do. For this reason I applaud Seasons 52 for keeping a changing menu. That being said the menu we got was the beginning of the winter menu which means most of the items were heart and rich compared to the lighter items they might offer during the spring and summer. The winter menu offered hearty things like salmon with carrots and mashed potatoes. I also had a white wine that was fantastic. In sum I will definitely come back to Seasons 52 in the future, probably during the spring or summer to see what they offer during those seasons. I'm a big fan of the concept they have going and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a restaurant that is a little more upscale.",5.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52
"Sooooooo a friend told me to check this place out before I made a lifestyle change to veganism. So after some research I saw they had a Vegetarian menu so that excited me, so now here we are sitting at a table fork in hand. First, our waitress was AMAZING!!! She held it down like a G!! Now for starters I had the Mediterranean Humus, which was INCREDIBLE!! The flat bread that came with it was good but the chips were outstanding!! My main meal which was the Vegetarian Tasting was ehh... The asparagus were over grilled and the fennel infuse onion was a half of onion that was just way to much to eat. The rice that came with it was good. Love how it had veggie protein mixed in. The Kohlrabi was very good but I would have preferred a carmalized fennel onion on top of it. It would have made for a better meal. That whole onion was a NO!! But all in all great experience. Love the live music that was being played.

"This restaurant was recommended to us by a few people and we decided to check it out. Definitely a very unique concept in that the menu changes seasonally. However, one this that remains consistent is that they are known for their flatbread no matter the season. It's pretty packed on weekends and we had about a 45 minute wait so I would recommend making a reservation if possible. There was also live music with a piano player, which I really enjoyed. We started out with Artichoke and Laura Chenel Goat Cheese flatbread and while I'm normally not a fan of goat cheese, this was very yummy! For our meals we ordered salads and I really enjoyed the Maui Tuna Crunch. The Ahi Tuna was excellent quality.

"Disappointed with the food and service. Waitress needs re-training. Does this place serve bread on the table? We didn't get any, but I wonder... Does anyone like needing to flag down servers for refills, and if it had lemon, wouldn't you bring a refill with a new lemon? Asked ahead of time for ""lots of sugar"" but still had to ask again for sugar. Can you please light our candle? Even after food was already served... apparently waitress was above bringing our food to the table when I asked her if it was sitting there, (I could see it for quite some time) she still didn't bring it.... she moseyed around until finally the food runner picked it up and delivered it!  I would have also liked if I could understand the waitress when she mumbled & talked very fast going over menu items -  I even told her, I have no idea what you just said.  Cooks need training. Dinner was dried out +had egg shells in it.  Green beans were dried out, without seasoning and undercooked - quite a terrible combination.  Meat was dry like sawdust.  Tried to eat it since I was pretty hungry.  Manager did comp part of the bill, but I certainly prefer to pay for a good meal instead.  Was looking forward to a nice date-night and a good meal.  I won't be coming back to Seasons 52 - it is a pretty restaurant, maybe go have a drink there instead of dinner, but bring a sweater, I saw several other ladies shivering from the cold A/C, Luckily I brought mine since it was a long wait through out and then to get our bill and finally leave.",1.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

If only they would have gotten the food right. I wanted to like this place. Virtually everything I ordered was hyper-salty. I ordered the blackened fish tacos, a side of chili and an app size crabcake. I expect that anything blackened would be very salty. But in my humble opinion the tacos went beyond even what I would expect for a blackened dish. It didn't end there with the tacos. The fish was first cooked to perfection and then cooked some more until the fish was perfectly dry. The soft tortillas were semi-stale. The crab-cake looked like a McDonald's hash-brown, had a mushy texture, and it tasted 'fishy.' But the award for the worst part of my meal went to the chili. It was watery and clearly thrown together quickly. Chli takes time to cook but this version of chili must have been prepared in under 20 minutes.

The lobster accompaniment is a great idea too. I love lobster and don't usually get the surf and turf option that restaurants usually offer. 3. You get a personalized photo for your birthday that they print on the spot and complete it with a cute flower. I love that, better than a group of servers singing to you. Things that could improve: 1. The hostess area. I noticed that while the hostess was very nice, it was a bit disorganized and there were too many people clogging the waiting area.

Two of our egg dishes were overcooked: the Shakshuka (pasture-raised eggs baked in a sauce of sweet peppers, tomatoes, chorizo and crumbled feta) and the Eggs Benedict. I personally decided to deviate and get the Lobster & Mozz flatbread, which had tiny pieces of lobster meat and borderline fishy.

It was bigger than I expected and depending on how hungry someone is, it can be eaten as a full meal. The pasta dish we ordered to split came nicely divided into two equal plates. That was nice of the kitchen to do. It's always messy when we try to divide it ourselves or have to drag food across the table dropping some of it on the way.

The porcini mushroom bisque and pesto chicken flatbread were both really delicious. The flatbread was thin and crispy and not just a pizza in a rectangular shape, which I appreciated. Their method for selling dessert is pretty smart - they present you with the options right away on a tray so you're more likely to purchase.

I had made reservations to Seasons 52 via Open Table and was easily accommodated. So naturally we arrived on time, and we were instantly seated right away to our table for six. What I loved about this place is that they hand wrote a greeting card and left on the table for my parents to see for their anniversary. Shortly after settling in, our server, provided us with champagne to celebrate. So naturally I was impressed. This was Michelin-style service for a chain restaurant! But sadly, after the champagne, everything had plateaued from there. Prime example: our server gave us false information on the number of duck wings were served in one order. His answer was 6 pieces, when I had asked before ordering, but when the expediter came out to serve the wings, she mentioned that the dish always included 5 pieces. It was one piece short for the number of people we had at the table which is why I had specifically asked. The issue was immediately rectified with ""an extra wing on the way"", but of course didn't help my overall impression. Example #2: NO BREAD BASKET. *crickets* Our table had ordered the Chilean Sea Bass special, the Salmon special, the rack of Lamb, two orders of the Filet Mignon, and a Branzino. The food was delivered in a timely manner which was satisfactory on my end, but judging by everyone's reaction, it was super hit or miss. My branzino was listed ""whole"" but unfortunately came with no head, and was going to be filet and stuffed with seasoning at the table. That right there threw me off. A - ""whole"" fish in my book means ""nose to tail"" B - it should have been stuffed with the herbs and lemon already. Instead my dish looked like something they meagerly put together by the broiler. I was totally not impressed. My brother and boyfriend were too a little disappointed in the portions. Granted the calorie count on the menu coincided with the portion sizes on the plate, but I was almost too hopeful that more veggies would be on all of our plates. Having had finished all of our main courses, our server comes out with a DESSERT PARFAIT CAROUSEL. Naturally, this all appealed to us, and of course, our server had a candle handy for my parents if they wanted dessert, (and they did). Almost all of us had selected a parfait (being so hungry), but  those itty bitty parfaits were too sweet!!! I later found out that those parfaits were like $5 a piece and could be a whopping 370 calories if you chose what your heart desired! By the end of the night, I almost felt gypped. Uh, Seasons 52, why weren't the parfaits on a dessert menu with their respective calorie count??

"I fell in love with the new Seasons 52 in their Bridgewater location but was in Edison while I waited for my car to be serviced.

Everything was delicious as I expected. And just around 6 ish, a pianist sat in the middle of the bar and played her own spin on various songs from Ray Charles to more modern artists like Alicia Keys. She had a pretty nice voice also!

"Stopped in without any prior knowledge about the place except what it says on the signage so I didn't know what to expect. Came in on Friday night at 8pm. They have complimentary valet if you're lazy to park yourself and there were plenty of parking spots around the other side of the restaurant. My party of two was the only party waiting for a table. Was told it was a 45 min wait but we found a table in ten minutes and waited 20 for it to be cleared. Service is not attentive it's slow. We waited and waited for our table to be cleared to sit, and waited some more to have table cleared while already eating next course. We had to ask for water, server only brought one water for two people so we had to again ask for a second one. We had to flag her down again to get refills, we had to flag her down for a steak knife. Service aside the food was great. Very flavorful. The slaw that came with the chicken skewers was so tasty and refreshing. Beef chili hit the spot, fresh tasting not salty. Also had the salmon, filet mignon and side of shrimp scampi.

I came here with my family to celebrate my mother in laws 51st birthday. The environment is warm and welcoming; pretty upscale and refined. The food and menu selection can be overwhelming so I would recommend checking out the menu prior to coming to dine. Keep in mind this restaurant is geared to a healthier lifestyle (many selections are 450 calories or less). I did not see anything that was too appetizing to me so I opted to get the truffle mac and cheese with the shrimp and crab stuffed mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty tasty however the mac and cheese was dry and lacked any cheese at all. The servicing size for the mac and cheese also reminded me of a portion for a small toddler. I also tried the pesto chicken flatbread which was just ok. I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to come here nor would I come back. It's one of those places that may be appealing to others and not for some.

"Came here while visiting NJ and meeting up with friends who lived nearby.  I would consider this a notch hirer than a Cheesecake Factory type of place. I think it's a local chain. We came because my friend said the piano bar is really nice and so we could eat and listen to some music. I guess we came to early but there was no piano bar going on. I was ok with that. Nice atmosphere. I get what they are going for. Trying some special twists and really nice presentation while getting a decent meal and a decent price. Good concept. They had a spring special menu for $29.50. I realized that anything that cheap for 3 courses is going to be ""good food"" and not ""fine dining"".  I had a nice Moscow Mule to start and shared a hummus plater (fine hummus - not outstanding).  Ordered off prix fixe and got their asparagus soup. It was good idea but it just didnt have that zap or zing. Dinner was the braised rib and I really found that quite tasty and very very tender. Nice choice of french carrots etc. Deserts were a choice of small shot size (perfect) parfaits, new takes on classics.  For a chain type of restaurant, I found it quite enjoyable. As it was in a large mall parking area, I was prepared for the noisy crowd of families. I usually don't pick places like this but for this type of restaurant, I found it better than Cheesecake or other places. I feel like they are really trying to make it a notch higher and with their presentation as well.",4.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

They also have 4 dollar beers and a  6 dollar glass of wine deal. We then proceeded the meal with two entrees, i ordered the beef ribs and he got the shrimp and grits. Amazing!

The food was better than we expected, especially when I know it is a chain store. I personally liked the sea bass and the lobster pappardelle the most. Shrimp and mushroom appetizer thing was also good. The trout and Alaskan salmon were too dry. We then changed it to the wood grill salmon and request the medium rare cooked-it turned out good. The dessert was kind of sweet but still good. We had two bottles wines. Good choice for seafood paring. The server confused by some of the dishes but he was really nice.

"I dig the concept of Seasons 52! All dishes are 475 calories (or under) and all dishes are season-inspired. The winter menu showcases more meats and root vegetables, however there are several seafood and vegetarian options. This place lets the freshness of the ingredients shine through instead of overly-salting and overly-saucing the dishes. Call me crazy, but sometimes I want a fresh, quality meal that won't break my calorie bank, nor derail my mad gym gains for the week. Woo!!! The sea scallops were light and tender and my venison was perfect. Not over nor under-seasoned and cooked exactly the way I requested. The mini dessert shots were fantastic. Just the right size with great flavor and texture. I could have eaten 10 of those bastards but that would have defeated the purpose. Bar area was active with live music (small piano). Located right off Route 1, Seasons 52 is easy to get to. Except my navigation directed me to someone's house. Thanks Google Maps, you're a real pal! Portions are not gigantic but the flavor is there.

"I'm a fan of this wonderfully sophisticated and quite unique restaurant. A beer swiller like me needs an occasional touch of class and this fits the bill nicely. I can't help, but to start with the specialty drink menu, I dig the jalapeños Martini, what a surprising touch of heat remaining on the lips just as you reach the bottom of the  glass. Several signature options to quench your flavor to savor. A tremendous selection of wine by the glass or better yet vintage bottles if you don't mind dropping some coin. The bar is an interesting oval of sorts with a small tuck in the middle where I've seen piano players; what a lovely touch especially on date night. Dining in the sectioned off fairly large room. Calm dimly lit setting a romantic mood, perfect for playing footsie or sneaking a grab under the table for you dirty old men, yeah baby. I love the water fall wall as you enter by the way. I'm absolutely hooked on the flat bread pizzas, reason enough to pop in. They have several options including the wild mushroom, my favorite and oh so devine. Many healthy options including a calorie counter on each plate, so expect portion control, so that means order more apps. Yellow squash soup surprised me with the subtle hints of cinnamon or was it brown sugar, I'm not sure; I should've asked, but a nice hint of sweetness in slightly thicker base, hmm hmm. Duck wings, quack quack. The Bronzini with a tender fillet blanketed with a crispy skin was tantalizing. Oh those short ribs. The entire menu clearly focused  on forward thinking health conscious dining, smart. The prices are a bit on the higher side and yes you can lighten your wallet if you splurge on the magnificent drink options combined with multiple apps to satiate a man's size hunger. Warm and inviting with typically exceptional product educated servers. Super clean with many individual dumping stations in the commode. Perfect when one desires more then a draft and wings. Leave the sweats behind for choice pocket square gents and skirt for the ladies although this is a causal  relaxed environment.

Service could be better waited about 15 mins before someone came to our table with an excuse of ""it's not my normal area"". Save it, didn't know your normal area didn't consist of serving people.

I cannot believe that I haven't written a review about this place sooner.  This is my second time at this location.  I love Seasons 52 and will follow them in every city if I could.  My first experience with this restaurant was while on vacation in San Diego California.  It's always best to make reservations. . I always do that.  Either directly with the restaurant or through OpenTable reservations.  You receive points when you make it through Open Table.  Just be sure to let them know if it's open table reservations because they have a different check in I do believe . My server name was Jaime and he was very efficient and constantly checked on us to make sure everything was ok. The food is sooo healthy and they try to stay under a certain amount of calories. Let me just say if you're looking for comfort food with high seasonings and a lot of calories.  Then Seasons 52 is not the place for you.  If you want high quality food with limited seasonings and more vegetables than give them a try and they have the best deserts ever !! Nice selection of wine and mixed drinks.  I  love Seasons 52 wine selection.  It's the best! As well as the Salmon with the Dill sauce.  Omgg so good! I finally switched up my menu to try the pork tenderloins and it was definitely worth it! of course l will be back to my regular menu on my next visit at my location in Columbia maryland.  This restaurant has a very romantic setting which l love but it also works well for family and friends. .

"I waited to write a review until I went a few times because this place is nearby and I wanted to get a good feel for the place. I know I've tipped but they are missing from the page. (?) The first time I went, it was on a whim during happy hour. I saw the $15 flatbread and flight special somewhere (probably on Yelp- haha). M and I really enjoyed this special- $15 for a flatbread and flight of wine plus one full glass that you choose after sampling the flight. We each ordered that and were pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the flatbreads paired with the flight of wines. The artichoke goat cheese flatbread was amazing! It's such a good deal and the flight is 3 wines PLUS one full glass once you decide which one you like best. We went back a few times for that happy hour special alone. Usually there is music behind the bar- a solo singer on the piano. It's relaxing and an affordable way to feel a little ""fancy"" and try something outside of the typical bar and beer happy hour. The decor is great - it has a very warm, sophisticated  feel for being a chain restaurant. I like that the menu is seasonal though I never noticed a huge difference in menu items the times I've gone (I've been for all 4 seasons). The food always tastes good and fresh and is presented nicely. The mini desserts are awesome! The bartenders (we've only ever sat at the bar) are typically friendly and attentive. The last time we went it was after happy hour so of course it was a little pricier. The chicken sandwich was good and I enjoyed a prairie mule and a whiskey cherry drink. The thing is- like any wine bar- the bottle is $24 in the store and they're selling it for $64. The mark up is crazy. A glass is between $7-12 and most times you could just buy the bottle at the liquor store for under $20. So I think this place is great for happy hour when you can take advantage of the ambiance and specials. The food is good quality and don't forget to order the mini dessert.

"We were here for a friends birthday dinner and were shown to a private room. The staff was very courteous while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The restaurant itself has a sophisticated air to it and true to its name it changes its menu according to the seasons. We were able to order from the winter menu and the choices were delightful. The staff was also very accommodating for the vegetarians in our party. I ordered the garlic chicken pesto flatbread as well as the porcini mushroom bisque. Both were delicious, although if you're looking for something more hearty those might not be a good choice. Both were flavorful and the flatbread had a healthy amount of arugula and chicken. The rest of my party also ordered the pork tenderloin that was finished perfectly and very juicy! The mashed sweet potatoes were also a hit. At the end of our meal, we were presented with a board of mini shot glasses filled with desserts. Personally I enjoyed the s'mores and mocha. Both were smooth and creamy and the perfect end to a lovely dinner! I really appreciate the menu that they have here that uses fresh ingredients and changes with the seasons, it's very refreshing!

"Great ambiance! Has a new york city vibe to it. The service is very courteous and attentive- I have nothing bad to say at all. I would highly suggest making reservations in advance so that you don't have to wait for a table. This restaurant's menu is appealing to a broad spectrum of people with different lifestyles. I can really appreciate them having a vegan-friendly menu because not a lot of places do in New Jersey. The artichoke flatbread: this was super light, crispy, and overall a good appetizer to share. If you like artichokes, I would recommend this (just ask without lemon aioli and anything else dairy if you're vegan). The presentation for this dish was also very nice. Shisito peppers: I was skeptical to try this because I can't handle anything spicy. This, however, was not spicy at all. Not very filling but they do give you a huge bowl of peppers. Vegetarian Autumn Tasting: Great variety of vegan options on a big plate. I was a big fan of this entree. The vegan paella was creamy and flavorful (a little burnt on the bottom, but I don't think the burnt taste was overpowering. The asparagus was light and delicious. The potato and vegan ""steak"" was also very good. Definetely worth trying out. Vegan pasta- this was probably my favorite. It was a lot better than what we expected because we asked for the marina sauce with no cheese or butter on it. It has a good crunch from the broccoli stalks too. Highly recommend!

"This is my fourth or fifth time here in the past few years and I would say this is a very consistent experience. Specific to this visit we were here pretty early for a Saturday night using a quick reservation from open table, our party of three were seated immediately and well looked after by our waitress Lauren. For the three of us (starving as we skipped lunch entirely) we ordered two appetizers. Chicken pesto flatbread which was very good and stuffed mushrooms which were a little salty - especially the shrimp in the stuffing. My wife had the filet mignon for dinner and I had the shrimp and grits.  The filet was slightly overdone for her request of medium rare more in the medium range. The seasoning of the meat was good but because of the not being especially tender and slightly overdone it did not wow her.  The shrimp and grits was good. I especially liked the chorizo and flavor of the grits. My sons plain pasta just isn't worth discussing. We both had decent desserts and overall very good service and a decent value overall made it a pleasant Saturday evening early dinner.",4.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"I've been to Seasons 52 twice, and I loved it both times.  I went once for lunch and once for dinner, and since they do not have an extensive lunch menu, I would recommend going for dinner to really get your money's worth. The braised pork flatbread was a great appetizer to share, or a great meal on its own.  The winter menu is so rich and comforting.  The brussel sprouts were great and crispy, and my boyfriend did enjoy the steak salad, but when he first ordered it, his steak was too over cooked, but they brought back a medium rare steak very promptly, which was great.  They have a very extensive wine menu which is a great pairing with warm comfort foods. When I went for lunch I opted for the lobster BLT wraps which were very light and delicious. I ordered the side potato salad for a little more substance.  Lastly, I do not think it is possible to leave Seasons 52 without trying their mini dessert shooters. So many options and all so tasty! I love the peanut butter one.  All in all, its a great place to go in Edison with family or friends.",4.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52
"This is what I'd call a ""for"" review. As in it's 3 stars for a chain and for being in suburban New Jersey. It's nice, but if it were a standalone restaurant in a bigger city it would have a ways to improve to being more than average. The food is overall good and they execute the seasonal concept well. I was happy to see they had some lovely Pinot Noir wines available by the glass, such as Etude, La Crema and Kim Crawford. You can request a small taste before you commit to a full glass and they will happily oblige. Salads are usually pretty disappointing. They might be seasonal and fresh but the produce isn't much better quality than what you'd find at your average neighborhood supermarket. You need quality tomatoes to make a good Greek salad, for example. This is New Jersey, tomatoes in summer are plentiful. But every time I've been there with my mother and she's ordered a Greek salad the tomatoes are watery and in some cases almost mealy. Mains are mostly better quality, especially meats and very good fish/seafood. The burger is surprisingly good. It has mushroom duxelles mixed in which have lots of umami and really complement and enhance the burger's meatiness. And it's served on a lovely brioche bun. I do like that desserts come in little portions so you can enjoy a small taste of something sweet if you're getting full, but most of them aren't especially good and are on par with something you'd have at Chili's or Applebee's. The only exception to that I've had so far is the lemon curd with fresh blueberries which tastes really fresh. Service is really friendly, but the quality of that also depends on who is waiting on you. We've had great service during peak times (and it can get PACKED and consequently very loud in there) and it's been slow and forgetful during slower times of the day when I was maybe one of four customers in the place. Guessing maybe servers were doing sidework, so I don't want to assume just bad service. So yes, I'll still come here because it's certainly one of the better options in the area for a nicer (and often healthier) meal when I'm visiting my family, but I wouldn't rank it as a favorite either.",3.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"Myself and great Yelper Maheen M. wanted to dine out at a restaurant together in Edison. We decided to come here. I made a reservation for 7:15pm (formerly 7pm) on Wednesday night. We arrived at 7:03pm, and the restaurant appeared to be somewhat crowded. When we got there, we were actually seated in a booth within two minutes. The fact that we were seated way before my reserved time was significantly grateful. We sat down with our menus. A few minutes later, our friendly waitress came by and told us their seasonal offerings and took our basic drink orders. We didn't order any alcoholic drinks that night. After our waitress came back with our drinks, we immediately placed our orders. Regarding our orders, we ordered a Lobster and Fresh Mozzarella Flat-bread to share. This was actually a chef's suggestion. I also ordered a organic field green salad, and a oak-grilled filet mignon (medium-well). Maheen ordered a cedar-plank roasted salmon. First, our lobster and fresh mozzarella flat-bread came out on a long, wooden plank. It contained scattered lobster, scallion and roasted pepper pieces, mounds of mozzarella cheese, and a drizzle of lobster sour cream. This tasted hot, fresh, and delicious. We both enjoyed that. Next, my organic green salad came. It contained lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese shavings, and croutons. Everything looked fresh. I was actually stunned by the size of that salad. At least I was able to eat some of it, take the rest home, and say that I had my serving of veggies that night. Following that were the entrees. I received my oak-grilled filet mignon (medium-well). The filet mignon was topped off with roasted mushrooms (didn't care about that) and red wine sauce. Also included was a mound of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and a small side of roasted asparagus with a tomato slice on top. Everything here appeared fresh. The red wine sauce was tasty, which added a lot of flavor to the filet mignon. Speaking of which, the meat was quite tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were delicious, and definitely not pre-made. I took the roasted asparagus side home. Maheen's roasted salmon appeared on a cedar plank. It was also served with a grilled lemon, a side of vegetables, potatoes, and some mustard sauce. That was actually presented really well. After the entrees, our waitress came over with a nice presentation of the dessert shooters (To the Yelper who thought these were complimentary - they're NOT!). They appeared in different flavors. That size is definitely perfect after finishing a good meal, unlike a big slice of cake. Could anyone eat all or most of those at one time? Sure, but NOT me and never will! :D I had a hard time choosing between s'mores and the macchiato flavor. But I settled with s'mores, which was good. There was a layer of chocolate cake on the bottom, then a layer of chocolate mouse mixed with chocolate chips, topped off with a marshmallow and a graham cracker. No blandness here! Yeah, I'll definitely recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate. The price for the shooters was very reasonable! Every time the food came out, Maheen and I snapped photos of them before we started eating. This was fun. I absolutely didn't care about the speed of the service at this place since we were busy conversing as we waited for the food and drinks. We really enjoyed that evening. :) The restaurant itself had a relaxed atmosphere with low lighting. Our table had a candle on it. We heard someone play piano and sing acoustic versions of ""Hot AC"" tunes. Just wasn't sure if that was live or from a CD player. Either way, this was all perfect. Our waitress was excellent. She had a positive attitude throughout our experience. She also stopped by our table to see if our entrees were fine. Finally, she packed up our leftovers in interesting little boxes for us to take home. Overall, this restaurant was great. The food was fresh and the quality was excellent, unlike that embarrassing non-chain restaurant that I went to in Wildwood. There was a lot of flavor in the entrees and desserts that were served to us. Also, because of the fact that this restaurant does get crowded at times, it would be extremely beneficial to make a reservation online via OpenTable to avoid the possibility of being ""hangry"" and waiting over 30 minutes for a table. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for a good place to dine in the Edison area. This restaurant can be entered in the Menlo Park Mall parking lot. The location itself is perfect for those in Central Jersey who have to utilize US-1 and NJ-27 (via Parsonage Road - which I utilized). Lastly, I'm giving a shout-out to Yelper Lor A. for her ""spot-on"" review of the day in regards to the freshness & quality of the food, location, and reservations idea.

"Seasons 52 is an off-shoot of The Capital Grille chain, which is probably one of the best chains in US. Seasons 52 is focused on the seasonal cooking (menu changes 4 times a year). Also the menu lists all the calories in every dish, so you can be really in control. I also have to commend the wine list - it has a lot of excellent choices at a reasonable prices, with many wines been unique and different. Particularly, we had the Chilean wine called Coyam ($70) which was spectacular. All the food was excellent - chipotle-spiced chicken skewers, lobster flat bread, grilled seabass - all very well made and tasty. Very nice and friendly service.

Be prepared that it is a bit pricey but we enjoyed our food. I got the filet mignon and my fiancee the roasted lamb. We did also get the dessert too. It is a pretty smart how they get customers to buy dessert. They have small dessert cups that They sell them at $3 a pop. All the different flavors are premade and presented to you at once. Pretty smart since more folks are likely to buy if only for $3  a person and immediately ready to eat.

"Seasons 52 is a fantastic new addition to the Edison area! First off, I love the look of the place. It's got a sort of home-y, but also sleek, and stylish, feel to it. The wood and stone design, along with the fireplaces and the like, give it somewhat of a den vibe that's really chill. That, paired with the slightly dimmed lighting and down-tempo light music create a relaxed, intimate atmosphere. The food is pretty great too, and definitely above-average for a restaurant chain. The cuisine is your standard American fare - think sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, etc. - but I like their healthy, natural approach. For example, I very much enjoyed the vegetarian tasting, with its quinoa salad and the tofu with mango chutney. The pesto chicken sandwich also tasted exceptionally fresh. The portions are also very manageable, which is a huge plus as someone who's often turned off by restaurants' overwhelming entrees. It allows you to sample around and try a lot of different things, and (since everything on the menu seems to be a winner) I encourage you to do just that. To close out the experience, Seasons 52 features what it calls a ""live dessert menu,"" where they bring an assortment of desserts in shot glass sized portions, and you make your selections straight from the rack. It's a great concept, since you get the chance to dabble around and try several different desserts in as close to a ""healthy"" fashion as cheesecakes and chocolate baked goods can really be. Kudos. According to our waiter, Seasons 52 makes it a point to rotate their menu seasonally. I'll certainly be back in a few months to check out the spring menu. Seasons 52 may be a chain, but the atmosphere and food are definitely worth it. An A-list destination in my book, for sure.",4.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"3.5 Very classy looking place.  Piano player singing in the bar is a very nice added touch and can be heard throughout the restaurant.  Our server, Sierra, was very pleasant. The place is kind of pricey especially the drink and wine list.  Some martinis were $14.  I thought I was in Edison, not Manhattan.  The price points on the wines I was familiar with also seemed high.  The mains are also on the expensive side and not particularly filling.  Note that each is advertised as being under 495 calories.  Nice presentation though for the most part. Our appetizers and desserts were excellent; 2 kinds of hummus, a flatbread with chicken was great, and golden beets with wasabi.  The dessert shooters were delicious; more so the toppings rather than the cake on the bottom but overall totally hit the spot. There was an issue with my sister's salmon and it had to be sent back twice.  They did do the right thing and comped us for that as well as dessert. I had an Ahi Tuna Salad as my main and I enjoyed it..just wished there was more of it.  My wife had lamb chops and enjoyed them but said her Caesar Salad was so-so. My brother-in-law enjoyed his chicken dish although that presentation was rather plain. Overall, it was a very good experience and a nice addition to the area around the Menlo Park Mall.  In the future, I'd be more inclined to go there for just appetizers and dessert, or maybe to just hang at the bar and listen to the piano player as the dinner course really didn't blow me away.",3.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

They were just starting to feature their spring menu items so there were allot of nice choices with yummy asparagus. We shared tuna tartare, (it was quite good) a roasted roma tomato flat bread (which was crispy and paper thin and just absolutely delicious)  and the shishito peppers (with roasted corn and goat cheese) -- they were really good too, could have been a bit more spicy, but you just never know with peppers what you're getting. For dinner 2 of us had the chilean sea bass, in an asian style sauce, with snow peas over a black rice of sorts...it was delish.  I had the caramelized scallops over a lemony risotto with peas and red perrier, plus grilled asparagus -- all were so good!",4.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"I visited the Cherry Hill location a couple of years ago with my friends before the chain began to expand further into NJ. I was very excited to hear there was now a location about thirty minutes from my house. The portions fit the 475 calories and under theme, but flavor was NOT sacrificed. I made a reservation two days in advance for a Saturday evening (at 6) for my family and I on my birthday. (We were a party of four). Between us, we ordered the following: goat cheese ravioli, two caesar salads, the flat iron steak salad, the pork tenderloin, and the scallops with risotto. Everything was DELICIOUS. The salad was a really big portion that my mom took home for lunch the next day. The presentation was really impressive, with the steak sliced and fanned out and the salad portion in a plastic cylinder that the waitress removed so it too spread out once the dish was on the table. My sister informed our waitress (Jonah) that it was my birthday, so before she came with the mini indulgences, she brought over a mini vase of flowers with a candle in a tiny glass and a happy birthday card so we can sing. It was very nicely done and she took pictures of us with my mom's iPhone, plus with the restaurant's camera. When she brought out dessert, she gave us the picture in a little Seasons 52 paper frame. It came out great! I ordered the pecan pie mini indulgence, my mom the amaretto (with a little amaretto pipette!), my dad the raspberry cannoli, and my sister the peanut butter chocolate. THEY WERE ALL AMAZING. The only reason I deducted a star was that there was a woman singing/playing piano at the bar that was piped in through the speakers at the restaurant. It was very loud and made it difficult to talk at times. She was talented, but half-volume would have been sufficient.

"My wife and I enjoyed Seasons 52 in Florida, so we were looking forward to trying this one. We were joined by a couple of friends who we had not seen for a while. We were looking forward to an evening of good food and conversation. Unfortunately, we couldn't enjoy our time together. We were seated in the corner of one of the smaller rooms, which was fine. But I was seated directly under a speaker in the ceiling that was playing live music from the bar area. The music was so loud, I couldn't hear our conversation. Being in a corner, the music reverberated around the area. The music was primarily vocals, so it sounded like the singer was seated at our table and singing right into my ears. I asked the hostess to lower the volume. She tried, but it seemed to get louder again a short time later. The waitress, although very nice, seemed unable to adjust it. I again went to the hostess area and asked for the music volume  to be lowered or to please move our table. She was either unable or unwilling to do anything and said the volume was as low as it could go. As far as moving our table, she just sort of shrugged. So I gave up and dealt with the music and enjoyed the singer's breaks. The singer was fine, but being primarily vocals and loud, it was a constant annoyance. So much for conversation. We were constantly saying ""what did you say"" to each other. The restaurant should accommodate its patrons better than that. Background music at a reasonable volume would have been fine, but the singing was too much. It's ok to have a singer, but keep that in the bar, along with the televisions. The food and service was good, certainly better than a typical chain restaurant. But, overall it was a disappointing, frustrating evening. Perhaps, if we were seated elsewhere it may have been better. But, I doubt we will try this restaurant again. That's too bad.",2.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52
"My friends and I enjoyed an excellent lunch here! First of all, the service is amazing.  Attentive, without being intrusive.  Our server, Kathleen was awesome!  She started off by explaining the menu and then asked if we were on any time constraints- which I thought was very thoughtful and sensitive to those who may need to head back to work.  My friends told Kathleen that we were celebrating my birthday and she brought over flowers and a handwritten card!  Plus she gave me complimentary dessert and a little birthday candle.  Then, the best part, she took a picture of us...printed it out and gave it to me as a keepsake!!  What a cool gesture! Now, onto the food.  The menu changes with the season so that they can utilize that season's ingredients.  The menu was eclectic, but not overwhelmingly so.  We started with the shrimp scampi skillet and the chicken pesto flatbread.  Both delicious.  For my entree I had the flat iron steak skillet, also delclious.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  Another added bonus: no item on the menu exceeds 475 calories.   Well then, that leaves plenty of room for dessert!  Desserts are served in shot glasses and are way more filling than they appear.  I had the key lime- tart and refreshing. There is an extensive cocktail menu as well.  I had the strawberry basil infusion and it was so different and tasty.  The drinks are a touch on the pricey side, but they leave the shaker with you so you end up with two martini glasses worth of boozey goodness. The wine list looked pretty good too.  They do a ""flights and flatbreads"" menu, which I plan on trying during my next visit.",5.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

The two drinks I experienced, the blackberry mojito and the cucumber smash, were fantastic. The cucumber smash was like a multi-note perfume. When you drink it, it has a very easy watery taste, but then the fun starts. The cucumber comes through, then the basil, and the combination of the two is like no other drink I've had before. Highly recommend trying this one! And the food was nothing short of spectacular. I know the menu changes seasonally, so food options change often. However, given that we didn't get a single mediocre dish, I'd say that you're safe going with anything on the menu. Everything tasted fresh, delicious, and left me wanting more!

My fiance & I first fell in love with Seasons 52 down in Tampa, & I was so excited when I heard they would be opening this location, a mere 40 minutes from the city (the next closest Seasons is more than 2 hours away!). We made reservations for Sunday night -- just to celebrate nothing in particular. The restaurant was fairly busy for a Sunday evening! We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 8:15pm reservation, but we were greeted by name & whisked immediately to our waiting table in the center of the room. The ambiance is dark & sexy, classy yet comfortable. Our server, Wesley, was fantastic. He was incredibly attentive & so kind. When we found out we loved the wine we ordered (Penfolds Thomas Hyland 2011 Riesling), he offered to bring back the bottle so we could snap a picture of it! Who does that? WESLEY does that. Thanks! After an appetizer of Jumbo Shrimp, we got down to business. My fiance had the Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout, and I ordered the Caramelized Grilled Sea Scallops, with asparagus & lemon risotto. Now can I tell you that it is just so difficult to believe that this meal is 475 calories! The risotto is so creamy, so lemony, so delicious. The asparagus is fresh & crunchy. And the sea scallops! The stars of the dish stand out as some of the best scallops I've ever had. Beautiful sear, soft & meaty, with a little bit of a sweetness. Even though everything on the menu looks so good, I just can't resist ordering Seasons 52's scallops every. single. time. Time for dessert! At Seasons, you always have to make sure you have room for at least one mini dessert. (In my case, there is always room for at least two, maybe three.) My fiance got the Key Lime Meringue Pie and the Mocha Macchiato, and I got Key Lime Meringue Pie and Blueberries with Lemon Curd. I was surprised that I liked the Mocha -- I tend to steer away from caramel, but somehow they managed to include it without overpowering the coffee flavor. The blueberry & lemon dessert was light, refreshing, and tart -- just how I like it! Key Lime is always delicious -- the tartness of the lime, the crunchiness of the graham cracker crumbs ... it's just perfect & I wouldn't be surprised if it was their most popular dessert. We finished our evening with some coffee & conversation, listening to the incredible piano player in the bar area. She had been playing all night, and she was so great that we stopped over after dinner to tell her that we enjoyed her performance.

"The worst experience ever!!! We took our daughter there for a 13th birthday lunch. Unfortunately we got the worst waiter who supposedly was new. He seemed checked out from the beginning. We wanted to try something different so we ordered grilled artichokes. They looked beautiful but were chewy and basically inedible. After alerting the checked out waiter he said ""I'll let my manager know"". Then came back and said I'll take it off your bill. Then the entrees came. Shrimp and grits had very little grits and were salty as heck. White chicken chili had about 3 pieces of chicken. We sat with our glasses empty for a while and tried to eat what we could. Finally I couldn't take the lack of service anymore so I complained to the Manager. She apologized and informed us he was new then offered desserts. The server then attempted to put some energy into his service. Too little, too late ESPECIALLY when we ordered tea service. He brought my husband a cup that came complete with lipstick!! He apologized AGAIN but decided to still charge us for it, I guess since he replaced the dirty cup it was only fair. Aside from the tiny gesture of comping dessert there was no other attempt to save this epic fail of a birthday lunch. We paid the bill and tipped the waiter but decided to never return.

"OMG this place was amazing! Sep.2 was my birthday and i just saw this place in passing and wanted to go. Made my reservation for 8:45pm for 7 people. When my friends got there they sat right done no wait ... this was a Friday. They gave me a birthday card and flowers too!Most of my guest arrived on time... its was my birthday I'm allowed to be late(9:45) well when i got more guest showed up then i expected so we asked to be moved.Our server was a-freaking- mazing! (yes i forgot her name but ill post the recite) she had no problem with moving us to another table for 11ppl...in moving us one of my friends brought be balloons and tied them to the chair as the chair was moved of course the balloon went flying. No worries because our server got on the chair and attempted to get it.(sadly we all belong to the little peoples club so one of my taller friends got it, the attempt was so appreciated) Now we did tell her we were wait for 3 more people l so I'm going to assume this is why she didn't come back...lie for a while lol but it was cool we didn't mind. Now my family and friends laughed all night(I'm sure we disturbed the other dinners (SORRY)) but no one from the staff came to tell us to hush or anything. The food was amazing! i believe the chief was black and a women (awesome) (not that it matters but its cool) everybody was happy with their food and their drink except one of my guest(she didn't know the shrimp and grits had bacon) Oh there was a guy playing and singing on the piano (Love love love ) he sang Beyonce halo for me and wished me happy birthday! They brought out dessert for me for i was all happy. The restaurant closed at 11, we didn't leave till 12:30! Even tho there was a server (not ours) who seemed a little upset we was still there it didn't bother us because we saw the manager walking around she didn't seem bothered. All in all i had an amazing time here and the manager wished me a happy birthday on our way out and our fab server took a group picture for us.

"I love how they change their menu so frequently. I recommend making a reservation on the weekend as the wait can get long. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The staff is very friendly for the most part and helpful. The wait staff is definitely trained to up-sell everything. Anytime I ask for a wine recommendation they typically suggest the much more expensive ones. One time I even ordered one, didn't ask for an opinion and had the waitress say ""uhh not my first choice but okay"". She then had me taste the more expensive one and I ended up just saying yes because she already has the bottle at the table and I felt uncomfortable saying no. Although that is my only negative encounter with a staff member there, it was very off-putting which is partially why I haven't been back since. The food is good, I enjoy the cedar plank salmon, I've also tried one of the steaks which was cooked perfectly. The salad with salmon on it is super tasty and presented in such a unique way. The desserts are my favorite part. They are perfect sizes and I have enjoyed every one I have tried.

More features like live music on select nights, private rooms for parties, and a decent wine list are more of its positive notes.

I took off one star because our waiter took forever to bring our water--as I had to take meds before the meal and food took a little longer to come out, about 20-25 minutes, if I estimated that correctly. The amount of food they give you is less compared to other restaurants but this is healthier.

"Yes a restaurant that is fully health conscious but that still has a classy vibe. I am a sucker for a great ambiance and Seasons hits the nail on the head, especially for a chain. I have dined at a Seasons in Long Island before and I'm glad that we finally got one nearby. The menu here is seasonal so expect it to change four times a year. If you are looking to pig out and be a glutton then this IS NOT the place for you. But if you are health conscious and want something that will satisfy your palette and cravings then this is the place for you. Even though we had a reservation we still had to wait close to 15 minutes to get seated. This is one of those things that needs to be worked on. Call me a snob but I make a reservation so I do not have to wait. Now on to the food. Mmm stuffed mushrooms with lump crab, shrimp. Blackend steak and blue cheese flatbread was incredible. Combining all the elements to make me crave more and more. For the main dish I had the boneless pork chop and not being a fan of sweet potatoes the server exchanged them for traditional mash.

"Inexplicably mediocre. We can't figure out what was lacking in the food, but it was definitely something. The plates were beautifully presented, the server Nicole was attentive and engaged, and the decor comfortable and upscale without being pretentious. But the food was simply ok. The clear star of the menu was the porcini mushroom bisque. Well rounded and beefy, it was packed with flavor, texture, and a lovely buttery mouth feel. The warm tomato and heirloom caprese was pan fried in panko (not mentioned in the menu), but still bland. You'd think 15 year old balsamic would have more flavor. Trio of mushroom flatbread was bitter, and I realized that they had included portobello in their trio - arguably the most bitter mushroom commonly available. Sea scallops were cooked well, with a slight char flavor. But butternut squash risotto should have been called a creamy pilaf. Squash was undercooked, rice clearly had cream added to it. And it certainly wasn't arborio. Lamb chops also frenched nicely, and cooked well (over temp, but that unsurprising. Most restaurants in this class won't cook meat True medium rare). But oddly bland. Salt didn't help. On the other hand, mash potatoes screamed of rosemary. The pomegranate seeds were whimsical but had to be picked out. Desserts shots were cute. I didn't find the presentation obnoxious as did other reviewers. The lemon curd and blueberry shot was nicely balanced. The pumpkin and ginger snap was bright with notes of allspice and fresh ginger. On the whole, I thought it was a good experience. I wonder if this restaurant is struggling with their niche. It's not quite fine dining, but it's notch above the Longhorn and Bonefish Grills of the world. Check out the HiHeat blog at hiheat.tumblr.com !",3.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52

"With all menu items under 475 calories, Season's 52 is a refreshing change in a world of excess. I first learned of this place down in Miami, where it was the venue for a sponsored lunch. At that time, we were treated to a few of the flatbreads, the chicken sandwich, the angus burger and an array of dessert miniatures. At the time, we were given a gift for use during the Holiday season. Luckily, there was a Season's 52 right in my neighborhood so off I went to see if their Northern counterpart was just as good. I think this place does an amazing job of coaxing flavor out of ingredients and not resorting to large amounts of butter, salt and cheese. The portions are small, but filling and the prices are a little on the higher side. My favorite item is the chicken pesto flatbread. The ""bread"" is more like the crust from an ultra thin crust pizza which a generous helping of chicken tied together by an amazingly flavorful  sauce. The lobster flatbread, supposedly their bestseller, was good, but the chicken pesto definitely won out. We also tried the Idaho potato wedges. While the flavor in these were good, the wedges were cut much too thick. The middle was more like a baked potato rather than true wedge. I would absolutely pass on these if you were counting calories. Lastly, the dessert minis are always a treat. I love that they portion control for you yet still manage to pack a lot of flavor into that tiny shot glass. I've had the carrot cake, the chocolate maccchiato and the pecan pie and the pecan was the only disappointment. Just waaay to sweet for my taste. The interior had a earthy lodge like feel to it.

"I've been to Seasons 52 a couple of times now and I really have no complaints so far. I didn't go the first time with very high expectations because it's a chain, but I was very happily surprised. The ambiance is just so cozy; dim lighting, a piano player behind the bar, candles on every table. The servers have all been great. They're familiar with the wine list and knowledgable about the food menu, and just all around friendly. The food is really delicious. I've had the Ahi Tuna Crunch salad, and the tuna was prepared better than many upscale restaurants I've had it from. Just lightly seared. Some places you request rare and it comes out with a weird gray rim and dark pink in the middle. This was the perfect pink color all around. We've also had the stuffed mushrooms, lobster flatbread, and last time I ordered the wood grilled salmon. It's all been so good! Plus, everything on the menu is 475 calories or less so you don't have to feel guilty about anything you order if you just hit the gym that morning. Don't get toooo attached to anything on the menu though; it changes weekly. At the end of your meal, another server comes to your table with this amazing assortment of dessert shot glasses. You can just pick one right off the tray and go to town on it, which can be bad because you don't have a chance to talk yourself out of dessert, but hey, it's under 475 calories, right?

They have a fireplace nearby, and the rest of the decor is a bit cookie cutter, but feels much more upscale than your typical chain.

In the span of 90 minutes I saw him twice, the second time being him running our food. I ate the ""seasonal lamb"" dish, which tasted like a mix of old fish and beef.

There is a distinct difference between not engaging your tables and not being in their even in their vicinity for them to engage you, we experienced the latter of the two.

I'd get plates of that all day and did by getting the sushi roll and the Tuna tartare.  Tartare is always a favorite of ours anywhere.  This was very good and love the crispy chips with it.  The sushi roll had a little too much rice and too little tuna but the rice was warm and fresh so that's a plus.  The tuna salad though disappointed me a bit. I love any salad almost and the radish didn't go well with the mix and the dressing was just ok. Had two amazing desserts though! The s'mores chocolate mousse and the pecan pie.  Both amazing!!

"We have been here twice and both times had a great experience.  For a chain restaurant I am truly impressed with the quality of service and food that Seasons provides.  Our second dinner experience at Seasons was particularly great.  My fiance and I had dinner here recently and not only was the food on point (just as it was the first time), but our service was truly wonderful.  Our server was sweet, attentive and very efficient.  She answered our questions about the menu thoroughly and made some great recommendations for wine and appetizers.  She checked on us regularly and made sure our wine glasses were never empty.  In conversation we came to find out we were both in the midst of wedding planning and she surprised us with a sweet personalized congratulations card and took a picture of us and placed it in a Seasons 52 frame for us to take home.  We were so very touched by this gesture and it speaks to the type of service we received that evening!! For drinks my fiance tried the cucumber basil cocktail which was sooo good and I had white wine.  We started with the lobster and mozzarella flatbread which our server recommended and it definitely hit the spot.  For dinner my fiance had the scallops with a side of brussel sprouts and I had the pork with a side of mushrooms.  Everything we ordered was great and we literally ate every last bite of our food. The decor is elegant with rich wood tones and warm lighting, there was a live singer both nights we went for dinner which was a nice touch. Overall this place is great and I would definitely recommend it.  We will certainly be back!",5.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52
"First great experience served by awesomely attentive Jenna for girls brunch. Started with artichoke flatbread & stuffed mushrooms, absolutely delightful California warm beets salad with goat cheese and pistachio. Desserts display and served ready without waiting ! Perfect portions, great service, affordable prices, great ambiance perfect for lunch or dinner. Will definitely return for the guest experience. I was greatly impressed even by the way the bill was split by guest order, simplifying calculations for the group. Shares parking lot of Menlo Park Mall. I look forward to my next visit.

"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I'm simply I love with Season's 52--the menu, the service--everything. The food isn't cheap but you so get a great value. The wait staff greats you by name and will accommodate special requests, plus they'll help you with making a selection if you need it. They'll also help you with making the perfect wine selection and will allow you a very small sample just to make sure your wine complements your meal. The meals are freshly prepared and are of just the right portion. They seasoning and presentation are perfect, and the bar drinks are expertly prepared. When you go, be sure to order a flatbread to start--you will not be disappointed. The Chilean sea bass over black organic rice is perhaps the best tasting fish dish I have ever had. The chicken and white bean chili is tasty with just the right amount of heat. The dessert minis are scrumptious. You might be tempted to order more than one, but they do run sweet, so I've found that one is just enough. In all the time I've been going to Season's 52, I have never had a bad meal. Two minor nitpicks. They have a piano player at night. Personally, I can do without that -I'd rather have the softer music in the background so I can hear my party without having to shout. And second, I'm not sure why they insist on having valet parking after a certain hour. They are in a mall parking lot--no need to have a valet park as there are plenty of spaces.  But again, these are two very minor nitpicks and do not diminish my overall opinion of this place.",5.0,"217 Lafayette Ave, Edison, NJ 08837",Seasons 52
"The first time I went to this restaurant was about 2 months ago (Edison location), and I must admit my boyfriend and I fell in love with it. It has become our go to for date night, and we always order the same dish. We usually start off with the stuffed mushrooms and/or the shrimp scampi as an appetizer; both which are phenomenal. For an entree we go with the flat breads which are absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend the Pepperoni flat bread as well as the Lobster and Mozzarella. It's a great portion for two to share. As for the drinks, our bartender decided to make us a quick drink she herself mixed on her own. We loved the drink so much, we called to make sure she was working behind the bar just to have her make us that drink. Her name is Jillian and her service is amazing. She was very easy to talk to and completely down to the earth. I would recommend this place to everyone.

"This past weekend the heatwave in the New York City area broke so it meant it was time to hit the road to satisfy my wanderlust... and ever growing lunchtime hunger. I live in Northern New Jersey and culinary wise that means there are plenty of opportunities to find a restaurant I've never been to, so it was off into Sven (my car's name) to scout possible eating locations. I thought it would be interesting finding a place I'd never been to before so while driving on Route 4 in Paramus I spied Bahama Breeze. Never having previously heard of the restaurant, I pulled into the parking lot. I could tell, based upon the number of people eating on the covered patio, this might be a good choice. Once seated I was greeted by 'Marley' (Marlena) who expertly took me through the rather large drink and food menu, informing me of her favorites and noting that many of the dishes have a ""kick."" Hey. I love spicy foods, it is Caribbean fare, so we were off to a great start. As a libation I chose the Painkiller; a coconut based sweet drink in a tall glass with spices and it was outstanding. Typically I stay away from sweet drinks preferring beer, but the description in the menu sounded so terrific that I was immediately swayed in that direction. Were I not driving I would have ordered another. My lunch consisted of the honey-sriracha chicken sandwich; buttermilk fried chicken on a toasted (and delicious) bun, seated on a bed of cabbage-jicama slaw, pickles and sriracha (of course). Sweet Christmas! What a sandwich. And, be not afraid... this isn't cooked ahead of time and then warmed up in a convection oven or microwave. One could tell this was cooked to order. My sandwich remained hot (temperature-wise) through my entire meal. As a side dish I opted for the cabbage-jicama slaw, and even though it was on the sandwich I didn't feel as if it was overkill. The portion was quite generous, not overly creamy and also greeted my tasted buds with a nice ""kick"" as well. Oh, and dessert did cross my mind, but fully sated I nixed that idea. Perhaps on my birthday I'll head back and (over) indulge. If you're fortunate enough to have location near you I'd highly suggest giving it a try. Based on my experience you won't be disappointed.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

Food: Mixture of Caribbean inspired dishes. I ordered the Jamaican platter and while everything does not taste like Jamaica, I really loved their empanadas. We also ordered a couple of appetizers but they were nothing outstanding. Now their coconut dessert is to die for. If you love coconut and pineapple. Get it! Service: Our waiter was extremely nice. A little too nice and a little too chatty but that is probably because I was already cranky from the long day. Food took a while to come out though and there seems to be lack of communication between kitchen/bar and our waiter since he had to run back and forth multiple times cause he kept forgetting items.

My friend ordered the Paella which was packed with great flavor!  When I come with my mom, the Paella is usually what she orders and the quick picture I took doesn't do it justice :) Overall, everything was great.  They also have an outside area with live music when its nice out which really gives it a nice tropical feel!",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"It's always tough to rate a chain place. They usually have mastered efficiency, but they don't always bring that extra oompf/uniqueness to the table that family-owned restaurants do. Having said that, I also think it's unfair to compare apples and oranges. Bahama Breeze is a solid chain place. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant, and they have good HH specials. They have a variety of fruity drinks to try if you want to pretend you're on an Island and not stuck in the cold. The salad I had for lunch this past weekend was delicious. Our quesadillas were fine..it was just an appetizer, so it was the perfect amount to share for two people. My Cobb salad was definitely better though. Overall, I love the warm, summery feel.

"Originally went to one of their chains in Florida, so I decided I should try one close to me when I'm back home (NY). I've been to this location a handful of times since discovering how close it is to me and I've honestly enjoyed myself each time. Some menu items are better than others but, I'd say you're always going to get a decent to great meal. The service is always great. This particular time that we went, we got our favorite firecracker shrimp, always delicious! We also ordered the Caribbean style lobster Mac and cheese. I really enjoyed it, the sauce they put on it was so different and the peppers in the Mac and cheese give it a nice spice. The fish tacos were a little bland, I wouldn't get them again. If they were seasoned a little better it would be a good light option for dinner. Fries came on the side and they were what you'd expect. Lastly, dessert (my favorite part of a meal). We ordered two, banana nut bread supreme and chocolate island. They both sounded so good we couldn't decide. If you can't tell from the pictures they were amazing, I'm partially biased because I love banana nut bread. All I can say it try it for yourself!

When the group swelled up to 17 I called the restaurant to warn them. The person I spoke to was wonderfully accommodating about the increase. She only asked that I keep her posted if anything changed. Come the day we had 21, and the staff at the restaurant couldn't have been more pleasant! We were accommodated at one long table, and the spillover guests were seated at table adjacent. Very easy for everyone to socialize. We had an excellent meal. We started with drinks and a few Island Hopper platters; the conch fritters were a standout for me, and everything else was flavorful and well prepared as well. And I can recommend the Goombay Smash for sure! Among the lot of us we ran the gamut on their menu and no one was disappointed. I had the Taste of Jamaica platter and was thoroughly pleased, particularly by the jerk pork, flavorful and not too hot. To my knowledge there was only one snag with our order, a missing empanada, which was brought out straight away once our very attentive server, (Nicole?), was told about it. I sure hope I have Nicole's name right, because she was great! She kept our drinks replenished and was never gone from us for more than a short while. So many people on a busy night, our meal could have easily been a train wreck. Instead it was joyous and completely satisfying. So well done, Bahama Breeze!

The outside dining area is also very nice too, especially with the tiki torches. Overall, I'd totally come back!",5.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"OMG, this place not worth the wait or the price of food. I order a seafood dish and asked if they could substitute the rice for something else, the nice waitress said no problem but obviously the chef heard something else. The food came out incorrectly and I sent it back. The waitress apologized. I get it things happen. My girlfriend dish looked ok but it was way to salty.",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"C'mon pretty mama - stuck in my head. Anyway. Bahama Breeze back of Bergen Towne Center is pretty chill. Really busy place so be prepared to wait if visiting on a weekend. I called and was told ""no reservations"" I asked about the ""Reserve Now"" button on their site, was told they knew nothing about it from the person who answered the phone. I decided to just stop by. To be fair, seating indoors had little to no wait, outdoors (it was 89 degrees and sunny) was about 25 minutes. Had mostly appetizers which included the Nachos - wife loved them pretty loaded, good amount of jalapenos and very little meat but large portion and tasty. No complaints. The Seared Ahi was perfect, decent amount for an appetizer, I would eat this every day. I have to mention the Smothered Pork Goodness, bits of pork, chorizo and cheese with, get this Yuca/ balls and a hint of guava BBQ, yeah. It was really good, would've love some more BBQ on the side, I'll ask for it next time. Last but not least.. the Rum Cake was moist with vanilla bean ice cream on top.. lick the bowl good. I was honestly surprised by these apps, they were above average for a chain type restaurant. The drinks were not watered down and the service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. The outdoor seating was the icing on the cake, a bit noisy but felt like a mini vacation. Will definitely be returning to check out the rest of the menu.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"This is has became my new favorite spot in Bergen county . When you walk in to bahama breeze they greet you so fast , I don't know about you but that makes me feel comfortable . It gives you an island experience with an island taste . The drinks are good here I had ordered the (Goombay Smash , Bahamas) let me tell you it's was prepared fast  but taste amazing . Everything that was mixed in this amazing drink you was able to taste it . The fruits that the drinks are topped off with are fresh once again letting you feel and see that island look you can get in Bergen county . Now for the food oh boy here's the good part  i had ordered a Bbq Bacon & cheese burger well done .  Now this burger  is a nice size burger that comes with Applewood smoked bacon  , melted pepper jack cheese  , Cole saw ( now when I read that it has cole saw I was like hmm interesting ) crisp fried onion on this soft bread called brioche bun. I was very impressed with this burger it was hot fresh and juicy all at the same and the fries are amazing as well . The host at the front greeted me the moment I walked into breeze .

"Honestly this place is easily overlooked because there aren't many of them around, and the parking situation kind of steers you away. But give it a chance! To start, it's a bit of a Caribbean fusion restaurant. Sometimes there's live music and the outside seating looks fun (though I haven't tried yet). But in my opinion, the space inside is bigger than appears from outdoors. Of the times I've gone, the service is friendly but a little slow. But I like that there's a lot of creative dishes, and specials too! Girlfriend and I shared the smaller portion curry duck as an appetizer and the meat was very good. Didn't know what to expect from the duck but I was very satisfied. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and she ordered the stuffed crab shells. Seafood has been great so far. And in the past I've ordered the coconut shrimp tacos. Also delicious. Wish the layout was designed a little better to allow closer parking without having to park in the mall garage deck.

Chris proceeds to then serve 2 people who showed up AFTER we sat down, he let them pay and everything. he finally comes over after we waited patiently and gives us our drinks. then he proceeds to serve 2 other people when we asked to pay. when i tried to call him over for the check he blatantly ignores me and serves the person next to me. now mind you, there were LITERALLY 6 people at the bar, all of who were NOT actively ordering drinks.

"The first time we went to Bahama Breeze was by mistake, what a great mistake that was. The establishment was nice, the food smelt great and our waitress for the day was Stephanie Peters. Therefore, she made our experience far better than it already was. With my background, it was nice to meet someone who is Trinidadian/Venezuelan. Furthermore, she totally understood what I wanted and totally gave me not just the hospitality and great service, but also the island experience. I am not an alcohol drinker, but my friend who was with me had me taste his mama's hooch & hollar: Bahama Mama, One Love, Goombay Smash. I must say they tasted pretty good and so did my virgin ultimate pineapple piña colada. Stephanie recommended the conch fritters, it has been my favorite so far. As a main course, we had the chef's selection, which is the Lobster & seafood pot and the taste of Jamaica: jerk pork, jerk chicken, beef empanada, callaloo, sweet plantains, white rice and black beans. Moreover, as much as we don't eat much pork or red meat, it was all a feast. I however, loved the lobster and seafood pot, felt that I needed a bit more bread to soak up the delicious juices. For dessert, we had the pineapple crème brûlée and the rum cake. Consequently, although they were both delicious, my favorite is the definitely the rum cake. Needless to say, that we were so freaking happy with our entire experience, we returned today with a friend to celebrate a belated birthday. The first thing we did upon our return to the Bahama Breeze, was to request Stephanie Peters. Her face lit up when she saw us, she gave us all hugs. We started out with the Island Hopper: consisting of Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings and conch fritters (my favorite), accompanied with a margarita flight: Hibiscus, Tamarind, Strawberry and ordered an extra tamarind margarita, because it was that good. Moreover, two of us had the grilled salmon & mixed greens on a tostada and the birthday guy had the coconut shrimp and the firecracker shrimp, with an order of yellow rice and beans. I wanted a bit of mango and Stephanie found me some in the kitchen. Of course, for desert we had the rum cake and a coquito. This remains one of my favorite to go restaurants, that makes me very happy. I must admit with an associate's degree in restaurant management and Culinary arts, I'm very picky with the service, what I like, and what I eat.  So, I strongly recommend Bahama Breeze and definitely request Stephanie.",5.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"Caribbean cuisine. Wasn't sure what to expect at Bahama Breeze after spending 9 days in San Pedro, Belize and being bombarded with all sorts of ethnic flavors. The real attraction was the conch fritters which were out of season(along with Lion fish) during our stay. The restaurant is well situated right off route 4 eastbound. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and we had reservations for an outdoor table. We were seated right away and given the drink specials. Aruba red beer for me and island drinks for everyone else. Appetizers and entrees were ordered a short time later.  Appetizers consisted of beef empanadas, guacamole and chips and conch fritters. I have to say the conch fritters were quite good(I'll have to wait for my next trip to get a real taste to compare them to).  The beef empanadas needed more meat stuffing inside. When I bit into mine it was hollow and all the filling had settled to the bottom end. It also lacked some seasoning and a little more heat. The entrees came and there were no complaints from the others in our party. The coconut shrimp and Tilapia dishes I was told were good. My taste of Jamaica consisted of Fried sweet plantain, rice and black beans, Jerk pork, jerk chicken and callaloo cooked leafy veggies(spinach or kale) either one they were good.  The chicken was good with just the right amount of heat. The pork was good and tender but lacked seasoning and some extra heat. Our waitress was courteous and even thought the place was busy she found time to go through all of her tables to make sure everything was ok and if refills were needed.  Overall I'd say I would come here again to sample some of the other dishes. Parking is tricky, we were fortunate to find a spot right in front. A plus is that they offer valet service for those who can't find a parking spot.

A recap: 1. Goat curry: Just meh.  Spicy but bland with a very meager portion of meat. 2. Shrimp and Mahi Mahi Bangkok Bowl: This was decently flavorful with bok choy, edamame, and slivers of shitake over yellow rice in a coconut curry broth.  The mahi was tough though and the portion was tiny. 3. Fried plantains: Pretty standard but still tasty. 4. Smothered pork: This was the highlight with tender pork. sausage, and chicken surrounded by cheese-stuffed fried yucca and covered in another layer of cheese.  A heart attack in a dish but definitely worth trying. 5. Caesar salad: Your standard although the croutons were seasoned well.

"Not impressed with this establishment.  We should have known as we waited for a host to acknowledge we even entered the half filled restaurant.  Our group of four was seated and it was obvious the server was slammed, not sure why. After being seated for a long period we were brought menus and he was ready to leave again and asked if he could take our drink order before he left, which he kindly did. We ordered our food and I ordered the crab avocado salad along with a cup of chicken tortilla soup to come out the same time. As our food came out we were served and had no cutlery so waited while the server went to get us cutlery.  Was not a quick turn around and by the time he came most of our food was cold.   Did I mention the soup didn't come out.  I reminded him of the soup and said it was on its way.  I finished my salad (mind you I'm a fast eater) and the soup came out.......not ice cold but room temperature. We were disappointed with the service and food, especially since it was suggested we eat here.

I've always been curious to try this place out, so we did. Of course, this place has a very island/tiki atmosphere, which attracted me to it. Only thing I could think about how great the drinks would be. The staff was very friendly and seated us quickly. We chose to sit outside in order to better appreciate the aesthetic of the restaurant. Our waitress first introduced us to the drink menu, which included a special of three different drinks all for $9. I immediately ordered this special, because you can't go wrong with three drinks for that price. The food-the menu was very diverse, which resulted in me asking the waitress to pick what she thought was the best and most popular option. (I am not a picky eater at all, so I don't mind.) I can't remember the name of what I ordered, but all I remember was that it was delicious. (Refer to my pictures attached to this review.) The waitress was very attentive which made us very happy guests, and will also make us return again. We came here in early September, meaning the weather was a little chilly, but that didn't take away from the atmosphere. I definitely look forward to coming here on a hot, summer day to enjoy the atmosphere even more and feel like I'm on a mini vacation, lol. P.S. The bar is HUGE!

"I used to frequent Bahama Breeze establishments on the regular about 10 years ago back in Arizona - unfortunately this experience put a sour taste in my mouth. My husband and I ordered the jerk shrimp skillet - which is always excellent - but it just went downhill from there. The Jerk chicken sandwich was bland, it's only saving grace the tasty bread. The chicken tortilla soup was a watery, second cousin of chicken soup. No flavor or spice, just overloaded with tortilla chips. The Black bean soup was decent, but my Cuban sandwich was a far cry from what I remember. The sandwich, which had the beginnings of something great fell into a soggy pit of despair. By the time I went to eat the second half, the essential crisp of a Cuban was lost to an overwhelming amount of mustard like sauce. When the waiter inquired if I wanted it wrapped, I said, ""I'd love to take it home; however it's just too soggy. I can't even eat this second half."" Waiter's response, ""So you don't want to take it home?"" Ah, like talking to a brick wall.

We preferred the small tables with one booth seat, but were told (in the 3/4 empty restaurant) that those tables were saved for bigger groups (which never came) and we (2) were given an oversized table for four. Thereafter, service was professional but not the typical chain-friendly so 3 stars there. As for the food, again, between 3-4 stars. The coconut shrimp is ok, but something needs to contrast the sweet coating. The seafood chowder was very tasty. Grilled salmon over mixed greens with avocado and bean salsa was enjoyable and I'd order that again.   It was a lazy afternoon visit so no drinks ordered.

"The first time I went to Bahama Breeze was for a Yelp Elite Event, and I was overjoyed that they had outdoor seating (despite the miserable view of highway). All of the food we got to sample was fried though (and I'm not too much of a fan) so I never really got to see the other side of things. So, I hadn't been back in a while, but the other day I wanted to eat outside to enjoy the beautiful day. We got to Bahama Breeze and there was a 15-20 min wait. You are able to get drinks at the bar and bring them out the front door to the little lounge seating area. Happy hour is from 4-6 and it's awesome. We were so excited. I got the Ultimate Pina Colada ($4). It is SO delish. We sat in the comfy chairs until they texted me that the table was ready. We sat outside and ordered the lobster & shrimp quesadilla. It was really good, but not the best ever. Then, I had the snapper with the plantain stuffed with rice, black beans, and cheese. Holy smokes, so damn good! During our meal, I got another drink before happy hour ended...had no idea that there was a happy hour drink menu until I saw the bill. Whoops. Would have been good to know... The host(ess) and servers don't really have the detail down. For instance, when we got the text that our table was ready, we walked in and the guy just started walking away with the menus, no ""Hi"" or ""right this way"" or anything.

"I think I have another review here of a different Bahama Breeze, the one down in Orlando to which I used to go every other day and that one has a 5 stars. Now I am at this location in Paramus, NJ. Got here about 1 hour and a half ago. The place was empty when we got here yet it took about 25 min for someone to ask if we want any water or anything. By the time our server came we already knew what we wanted to drink, eat and which desert we wanted. I ordered a sangria which came in a glass half full. No fruits or anything but a lot of ice. I've had sangria here before and it doesn't look like this. The floor is all sticky, the floors are dirty and full of garbage from the tables...no sweeping around this place. And then there are the fans, located right above the tables, so filthy I can actually see the dust falling in people's plates. It is absolutely disgusting. I love Bahama Breeze and they have very good food, a few very cool dishes that I like but this experience is just plain disgusting. The reason why I am writing this review while I am still sitting at the table is because it takes another 30 min to get the check and pay so one thing I did have while I visited this place was time...to observe every little disgusting detail about it. If I had a full glass of sangria maybe i'd feel better....",1.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

Our server was Nikaury and she was outstanding. She checked on us regularly and was very nice and pleasant. Our food was great and it came out without much of a wait. I did go inside to the bathroom and it was clean but the entrance from the patio area floor was wet and a little slippery although I had sneakers on.

"Bahama Breeze is my favorite chain restaurant. That is, of course, a dubious distinction, especially since I don't frequent chain restaurants all that often. Went there with my older son the other night and was impressed with the quality of both the food and drinks. Our server, Rob S. was outstanding. Being that most chains encourage their servers to be overly gracious, his demeanor was more than welcome. He was attentive without being over bearing, friendly and all around awesome. I ordered a mojito and a coconut shrimp appetizer. As others have mentioned, both were pretty awesome. My son said his chicken was also really quite good. In this area, there are a lot of restaurant choices, especially among the national chains. It's nice to see that Bahama Breeze has risen to the occasion and has elevated the food and service game. We will be back there soon and will, of course, ask to sit with Rob. Great job.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"Don't make the mistake I did. I searched my iPhone for a Caribbean restaurant nearby. It gave me Bahama breeze.  I called and asked about beef patties they said they didn't have them but they had empanadas. Not knowing what empanadas are (like beef patties I was told) that should have told me that this was not a traditional Black Jamaican restaurant.  I asked  if they had rice and peas they said yes, so I assume it was Jamaican rice and peas: wrong When I got there I found European Americans and European Spanish Americans nice place with an island flavor packed with tons of people and live music.  Hmm. I asked about The rice and peas they said yellow rice and black beans. Hmm My first mistake was going on Mother's Day. My second mistake was not asking them on the phone if they were a Jamaican restaurant. This is a very nice Spanish seafood place that seems to make a pretty looking jerk chicken, but has nothing to do with the caribbean. If I was smart enough to read the yelp reviews and look at the food pictures first I would've known this, my bad. The people were nice I got my takeout and learned my lesson.

"I'm solely rating THIS Bahama Breeze location since I've had totally difference experiences at other locations. I came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was EMPTY but because it's in a strip mall, there was no nearby parking, we had to go to the garage. We went inside and realized it was freezing and opted to sit outside. We received menus and watched as other families were also seated outside. 20 minutes goes by and all the tables around us have been greeted and received their drinks before anyone even says hello to us even though we were the first people seated outside. The waitress proceeded to deliver us the wrong appetizer but didn't come back for so long we weren't able to complain (asked for Ahi Tuna which is supposed to be sesame crusted and sliced, but received a small round lump of tuna and avocado and rice). I got the 'build your own seafood' Salmon for my meal, it was so tiny I left starving and the mango stuff it came with us inedible. Another person at my table ordered the Jerk Chicken sandwich which was good but the side was supposed to be fresh fruit with mango sorbet and it was just a sad, soggy bowl of honey dew melon. It then proceeded to take 30 minutes after our plates were cleaned for a waitress to make eye contact with us so we could pay and leave!",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"Came here on a Saturday for a ""girls night out"" with reservations for 9 at 7:30pm. That being said, we were not seated until 8:10pm. My company politely made a comment asking if a wait this long was normal with making reservations. To our surprise, a few minutes after being seated, a gentleman in charge came over apologizing for the long wait and ordered us two Island Hopper appetizers, on the house. Anytime a restaurant can make up for a fault on their part with free food is a-ok in my book! Because our appetizers were taken care of, I ordered the Seafood Paella as my entre. My eyes have always been bigger than my stomach as this dish was of decent size with a larger portion of seafood to rice. I loved that it came with a healthy dose of seafood because it made me feel like I was getting more bang for my buck (that and I got to take home leftovers!) Now it wouldn't be a ""girls night out"" without some libations.. so I ordered the margarita flight (which can be customized to whichever three flavors you want to try). Not sure if this is something offer all the time, but 6 new margarita flavors had just been introduced and there was no way I could choose just one! I absolutely loved the Hibiscus margarita flavor and the flower it comes with! The Mangorita had a spicy kick to it, and me not being a fan of spicy meant I was not a fan of this flavor. Lastly, I remember the Grilled Pineapple margarita as having a pulp-like texture to it which I also didn't like. I look forward to coming back and trying all the other many flavors! :P",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

I had the crab and lobster quesadillas and ate it ALL. Everything came with a lil side of fruit and seemed really fresh. Jason was super pleasant, polite and professional.... just a great server.

"Bahama Breeze is probably one of the better affordable chains in the area. The food is Americanized Caribbean cuisine. Interior is nice and the outside seating under the cabana is very nice as well. The drinks are probably the best things about this place. The huge pineapple thing is a beautiful thing but the painkiller is usually my go to. The foods pretty good too. The habanero wings are amazing. They mix it with bbq sauce so it's got a spicy and sweet taste which I really like. Empanadas and coconut shrimp are also great appetizers. Not crazy about the jamaican chicken wings or the conch fritters. The jamaican wings are just meh not super flavorful like their habanero wings. The conch fritters are a little bread-y and the peppers in there take away from the conch taste. For meals, the chipotle beef rice bowl is usually my go to. Recently tried the shrimp and grits and loved it. The shrimp is sauteed with bacon and mushrooms. All in all, Bahama Breeze is a good for a chain.

I held off on the mushrooms and added broccoli and thought it was really good. With my leftovers I ended up adding sautéed spinach and salmon (yum!). I had a skinny Mojito for my drink.  It was pretty good (it had a typical skinny taste if you know what I mean-kind of like fake sugar) but I thought it was good and did the job. Our table ordered the sampler appetizer. It was also good. Good variety of things! The atmosphere is pretty nice. I didn't sit outside but that seems like it could be really nice on a summer night.

This is very important. If the bathroom is clean, 9 times out of 10 the kitchen and rest of the restaurant is clean. Moving on. They have AWESOME tropical drinks and just a cool vibe here. When I'm feeling it, I like to get the pina colada/strawberry daiquiri mix Appetizers Coconut Shrimp - awesome Jumbo Lump Crab Stack - GET THIS! Layers of fresh avocado, chilled shrimp, lump crab meat and mango. This is my absolute favorite thing on their menu. Spinach Dip - typical spinach and artichoke dip, great for sharing I usually just come here for apps and drinks.  But their dinner menu is great too. Jerk chicken is a good one.

"If I had not found a hair in my food I would have given this place 3-4 stars. But shouldn't have been surprised after reading a couple reviews. When we first entered no one really greeted us. We were told it would be 25-30 minutes to be seated. That's fine. So we decided to get drinks at the bar as we waited. The bartenders were really nice and the drinks were pretty good (couldn't really taste alcohol in line though). We also decided to order the Island Hopper which was like a platter of the appetizers. The chicken, coconut shrimp, and conch fritters were really good. At this point we had already waited 30 minutes, but being Friday we decided to wait ten more minutes. It had taken a total of 55 minutes. Once we were finally seated, our server was really nice, even helped us out in picking our food (and didn't direct us to the more expensive item). Table was incredibly sticky. Our food came out pretty fast, but my friend didn't really like her chicken quesadilla and as I was mixing my calypso shrimp pasta, I found a long black hair. It took us a minute to find a server, after bringing it to the back to make me a new one (hoping it was a new one, should have just order something entirely different), our server had apologized and taken it off our check. From the moment we sat down to the moment we paid, we probably saw our server 5 times. Taking our drink orders, entree orders, seeing if we're okay, to apologize about the hair in my food, and the check. No drinks were refilled and after taken my utensils away with the first plate they never brought me new ones so we had to find another sever who could. Now our server wasn't bad, probably just stretched out among several tables. Ambiance was nice but a bit dark. Music was nice and the guy doing it was pretty fun/funny.

"For a chain restaurant their food and service is 5 stars. On Sunday nights after 9pm (and weekdays 4pm-6pm) they have happy hour at the bar area which is great. Beers are $2, well drinks $3-$4, and speciality drinks like classic margarita, Mojito, Bahama Breeze drink are $4.  All appetizers are half off which is great also. Service was quick and friendly. The crab stack was fresh and had a good amount of avocados and shrimp. Lobster and shrimp quesadillas were also tasty; didn't taste much lobster though. I wasn't a huge fan of the Jamaican jerk wings as the wings weren't really cooked in any sauce but the sauce was given on the side and the wings were relatively plain and dry. We arrived at 10:30pm and weren't really asked if we wanted a second round since it was closing time.

"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner this past Thursday to eat somewhere new. First, I really love the outside seating area and hope to be back during the summer to use it. As for the restaurant, I liked the decor. It was Caribbean themed without being over the top. And I can greatly appreciate that the plants are real! We each ordered appetizers. He had the coconut shrimp, which were golden and delicious, and I had the shrimp & lobster quesadillas. I thought these were pretty tasty. For dinner he ordered the steak, which I personally didn't love. I like medium rare whereas he likes medium well so that could have something to do with it. The garlic mashed potatoes that it came with were soo good. I ordered the jerk chicken pasta and absolutely loved it. It was creamy without being overt so, and the chicken, asparagus and mushrooms were great. I ended up taking half home and absolutely would order this again. Dessert was the dolce de leche cheesecake which was very creamy. For drinks he has a zombie and I ordered the mango margarita. No idea what was in it but it was very good. Refreshing. For your typical chain this place is overpriced. Our bill hit in the $90 range. It would have been cheaper, and just as suitable to go to Olive Garden next door. Yes I enjoyed the food and the staff were all very friendly but the prices are a little too high for the chain restaurant quality.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

And then for dinner I had a chip-ole rice bowl, which was perfect, steak, chiptole sauce, rice, and beans...YUM! It was even better heated up the next day I think. Finally to drink, I had a ""painkiller,"" this is a famous drink from the Soggy Dollar Bar in the British virgin islands.

"Went with a couple friends opening week and service was awkward. I did love the calming Caribbean atmosphere along with the smooth tunes in the background. They do have call-ahead reservations but if there is no wait they will not take your name down. We did not have to use this but as people start to figure out this place is now open I foresee it coming in handy. We went with friends who have been before so we ordered top picks which included Jamaican jerk wings, beef empanadas, fish tacos and seafood chowder. On top of all that, we also had yucca frites and the server suggested the chicken sliders. Jamaican jerk wings- good char on the outside while moist on the inside but not as a good as the jerk in Jamaica. Beef empanadas- good filling, very tasty. Fish tacos- I enjoyed the chili sauce that accompanied it so definitely put that on before taking a bite. Seafood chowder- creamy and delicious. Yucca frites- deep fried yucca with parmesan cheese and truffle oil. Enough said. Chicken sliders- pass on this. Reminds me of the chik fil-a sandwich. They also have a long cocktail menu and their own beer called Aruba Red. Grab that beach drink and pretend you are on vacation! Okay on to the bad. Our server was very awkward (maybe because it was her first week?). We asked for additional food suggestions and she said besides the beef empanadas she doesn't really like the food. Hmm it makes me uneasy when the server herself won't eat the food. Then another suggestion she made was the chicken sliders which I probably will not order again. I understand that this is a chain but there should be better promotion and knowledge of the food. She also insistently pushed on dessert. I am hoping this is a first week fluke.

I sat & waited but NEVER received a phone call. There isn't anything Caribbean like about any of the food from this restaurant. If you're looking for Jamaican jerk chicken, this is NOT the place to go. Let alone they don't even have anyone in the kitchen from the islands. It was just a horrible experience overall.

"I really want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars, because the food here is amazing-especially because it's a chain restaurant. However, every single time we come here we have a problem getting seated. Every single time. We have come on numerous occasions for dinner and are either met by an empty hostess station, or an unreasonable wait time considering the amount of empty tables that are in plain view. Just today, we stopped in for a late lunch. The restaurant was empty. There were maybe 10-15 tables sat. We were told there would be at least a 25 minute wait. On a Saturday afternoon. This was my final straw which prompted my review. A 25 minute wait at 3 pm on a Saturday when hardly half the restaurant was full is beyond unacceptable. The only reason we ever come here is because they keep sending us coupons in the mail, and like I said-the food is fantastic. I'll write a little about the food just to give credit where credit is due. Like I mentioned, this is a chain restaurant and I typically avoid chains because the food is really sub par. Bahama Breeze is an exception to that rule. The food is so unique and full of flavor. I have never been disappointed by a menu item here. Some of my favorites are the habanero wings (literally my favorite hot wings ever), the skillet shrimp, and as a main course the shrimp with grits (ask for it with Sriracha sauce!)

"I have eaten at a number of Bahama Breeze restaurants. I have dined at locations in Orlando, Tampa, Kennesaw GA, and lastly the Paramus location.   I have to say the food and service have always been outstanding. The chain seems to be very consistent. I felt compelled to write this review regarding the Paramus location because of the wonderful customer service. My gf and I are not the type to send stuff back or complain much. This case was no different. Although my jerk chicken pasta and beef empanandas were great, the chicken on her grilled chicken salad was very rubbery.  She didn't make it know until she ate most of her salad, because she was so hungry. At the end of the meal she just wanted to point it out to the waitress and let it go at that.  The waitress acknowledged it, apologized, and said she would tell her manager. She came back and said the chicken salad was removed entirely from the bill. We hadn't expected that, nor did we really want her to do that. She then wrapped the rest of our food up. Just a nice gesture and great customer service all around. We paid the bill and left. We had wanted to get the name of the server but she must of went on break and we couldn't wait any longer.

"The last three times I have come to this place, I have just plainly been disappointed...nothing but slow, ignorant service. The last time, however, is the one I really want to explain, which I really hope a manager might see. I came with my family during the evening and wanted to be seated outside. Two male hosts were too busy to even acknowledge us standing there. When I finally gave my name, I was handed a buzzer by the first host and was told that it was going to be a 25-30 minute wait for the patio and that my family and I could sit outside. After waiting 30 minutes, I went inside to an empty host stand until the second host decided to finally ask if he could help me. I asked how much longer it would be and was told that it would be just a few minutes longer. So I went outside and waited again, watching all the empty tables opening up, not being cleaned. Now, I've worked in the restaurant business all my life and I understand that some tables need to be kept on hold for reservations or for the guests waiting before others. But no one was waiting and no one was being sat. After an hour of waiting, I went inside and told the first host that my family and I could no longer wait to be seated outside. He replied by saying, ""It'll be just a little longer."" I told him that waiting an hour for an outside table, on a patio with six empty tables was unacceptable, especially since there was no one else waiting. He said, ""what's your name?"" I told him my name and he said, ""Oh, I see you here, but I didn't even know you were waiting."".....REALLY?! I could have guessed that. He offered to have us seated right away but honestly, after that, we didn't want to even give a penny to this place. As we walked toward our car, the second host was sitting on the railing smoking a cigarette and told us to have a good night. All I said was, ""yeah ok.""

They sometimes have a live musician playing some Caribbean beats on the Xylophone or metal drum or whatever it's called. The outdoor space is also a nice touch. But the best is Happy Hour. Mon-Thurs 4-6 pm (95% sure these are the hours but don't quote me). Appetizers range from $3-5 and drinks $2-6 (again don't quote me, but trust me it's a great deal!). So easy to get drunk and have a meal for under $20 during this time. Just don't go get that Xanax refill at Target right after because the pharmacist will call your doctor to make sure you are not abusing it.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I truly expected better service. The young lady who waited on our table did not write the order down after taking forever to come to the table. She forgot one of the items we ordered then told me i didn't order that, asked me if i was sure. I told her that it was the first thing i ordered and asked her, why would i lie. I only ordered a few things as it is. She was too busy laughing and dancing to be able to focus on what she is there for... work. Management truly needs to make their employees understand that accuracy is important and that they shouldn't challenge customers. Although young their employees need to be held accountable for their professionalism. Tisk, tisk. Even though the food was okay, I have not been back, and will not be.

Overall, they need to pick up the pace and organize more. They have a pretty decent happy hour along with specials.. i think they should extend it to another hour or so...and do more weekend specials--trust me it will pay off..especially with the mall right there. ( now i see they have a late night happy hour--this sounds like fun =P ) The bar area is so hectic the majority of the time,its hard to grab a seat..deff add more tables. As for food, I've only had a few snacks here and there. The Yucca fries are good. I heard the beef empanadas are great also. I see they added more apps onto the menu--so i will try.

"I had come here once with a friend and we got a nice table in the outside area. The wait staff was friendly and polite. So, props there! For my drink, I got something fruity which wasn't overflowing with alcohol. I had to get a few down in me and I still wasn't feeling a buzz at all. After a while, I just switched to beer. I must have spent half my bill on alcohol alone. For appetizers, I ordered the coconut shrimp, which were okay. Not the best I've had and they were recommended to me by a friend. The main meal, I got the Key West Fish Tacos, which were okay. Again, not the best I've had. Could have had more flavor. Otherwise, it's a pretty decent spot for a seafood chain.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"The first time I was here was on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The food was good and the service was excellent...I ordered the fish tacos which were really good, to which I ordered it again the second time I went.. Yesterday I came around 6pm and surprisingly wasn't too busy. My family and I were seated right away only to get no service for a good 10-15 minutes. A waiter didn't come by to let us know she'd be with us in a few minutes. However, when someone did finally come, she apologized for the wait and rushed through introducing herself. We placed our order right away since we were waiting for a while. We ordered regulars drinks (water/tea) and didn't get the drinks until the appetizers came out, which was about another 10-15 minutes later. Our food came out at a pretty decent rate. We had the seafood paella, which would've been great if it wasn't overly salty. My mother ordered the fish tacos, which I'm assuming you can get fried fish or grilled fish because the dish we got didn't look like the picture in the menu, or the first time I had it. The fish tacos were ok but was extremely liquidy. My father ordered the baby back ribs which was surprisingly a big rack. My brother ordered the lobster and shrimp linguine which was also good. The restaurant has a great outdoor space with the small problem of it facing the highway, but it's definitely good to hang out and eat there. I'd suggest people to try this place because the drinks are pretty good, but the food you'll have to judge for yourself.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"If theres one thing i love it is writing a review that can be 100% positive.  I frequent Bahama Breeze especially the Paramus location.  What made tonight even better than my usually great dining experiences was the stellar, genuine service given to us by Alyssa.  From start to end, she was phenomenal.  We were greeted immediately and with a smile despite how full her area of the restaurant was.  She pointed out your flavored rum flights (which i never knew existed) and sparked my interest.  I think she noticed we looked confused by the way it is listed on the menu and she perfectly described the flavor profiles of each and we were SOLD!  The Shark Attack (we chose the ""stiffest"" of the 3 options) was awesome- complete with garnish.  Yes, I asked the annoying question ""whats good here?"" and Alyssa actually took us through EVERY section of the 20something page menu and described one house favorite and one personal favorite from each- using such language that I felt I could taste the items being described- SERIOUSLY.  We were never once rushed to decide (and we were def annoying!) and upon ordering she offered the addition of a soup or salad- we never knew you offered soup until then!  We chose her favorites- the seafood chowder (WOW!) and a house salad (key ingredient- pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top) and they were lovely starters.  The fresh seafood entree (another item we always missed bc it is listed on the front cover) was perfectly executed along with the Steak Oscar entree.  Alyssa offered to brew a fresh pot of coffee for us after our meals which led to us ordering dessert which we had not planned and it was worth it.  I was compelled to write this review to recognize Alyssa's beyomd outstanding service and salesmanship and I truly hope she is recognized by your company. Not only will we return, but we will request her service every time as truly tonight blew away our previous visits.  We left Bahama Breeze feeling like we made a new friend- one that truly cared about the level of our dining experience and not just going through the motions.  Alyssa- if you by chance come across this review THANK YOU for kicking off our weekend.  And to management- please pass this along to Alyssa and your staff- truly a gem tonight!  We are very much looking forward to our next visit!  Thank you!",5.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I've been here multiple times since my last review and i've still got the same feelings.  The food here is pretty decent and nothing beats their awesome happy hour but the service needs work and that's always a shame when the place has such potential to be great.  Be prepared to wait and wait and wait....don't come here if you're in a rush.  I went for the 9p-12p happy hour to get some drinks and food.  We sat right at the bar and our waitress came over took our drink order and then took what felt like forever to come back and get our food order.  We ordered the shrimp, chicken quesadilla, and carnitas tacos.  Our order came out and we were missing the shrimp which never came out.  The waitress never came back to check on us at all until we flagged her down and told her we were missing the shrimp.  Finally when it was all said and done flagging her down again to pay was a process.  Maybe it's just the bar area that's like this?  I will admit I mostly dine in the bar area when I do go but nonetheless i think service can be better.  Also the time before that there were some fruit flies annoyingly around the bar area which was also a turn-off.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"This is the best place to go for a date night. Specially in summers because you can sit outside and enjoy the the breeze (Of jersey of course). I went with my fiance and it was really romantic. We went on Sunday, late night(another plus point they close really late). They had live music playing, fake fire poles and very polite servers.

"I do like Bahama breeze, the reason for this review is low because of service (by the hostesses) and the nickel and diming on the bill.  First, after a half hour wait for an outdoor table we were sat at the last table right next to a door which was basically in the parking lot.  When I asked for a different table (which there were many) I was told they were all reserved.  I asked if specific tables could be reserved and was told yes, then went online to make a reservation and it is clear that specific tables can not be reserved, therefore I was outright lies to... A few minutes later when a high top got up, just like the one we were at, I asked if we could move.  I got a few dirty looks, but was *allowed to move.  Ordering went fine and the food was good.  The next issue came when we were charged $1 for a glass of tap water (for my wife who also got a margarita).  Then realized I was charged $3.50 for a kids lemonade... I hate the nickel and diming and that is the reason for the bad review.  Fair or not, I will deduct $1 from the waitresses tip...",1.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

Service: decent. didn't treat us like queens/kings or anything but they were polite. Food: i ordered the grilled chicken with cilatro crema. (I think it was called.) delicious. but was sitting next to a girl we was dining with saying her rice tasted like ""microwave rice"" and that the jerk chicken was a bit dry. so i guess its a hit or miss typa' menu.

"My boyfriend and I went to Bahama Breeze after hearing about it from a friend. We called ahead and heard there would be live music and decided since it was a nice day out, cocktails and an early dinner was the way to go. We were seated immediately when we arrived on the outdoor patio, which had just opened up a few days before. Unfortunately, the live music was located indoors that day, but we were told that once the weather is consistently warm, the music was often located on the patio outside. Food: We ordered the firecracker shrimp appetizer which was lightly fried, but very good with a Sriracha ailoi on top. I don't like spicy foods, and I was able to enjoy it. Unfortunately, our waiter had misunderstood our order and forgot to bring us the appetizer until after we had finished our meal, however it was the best part of the meal and I'm glad we ordered it. For entrees we ordered the jerk chicken pasta and the fish tacos, both which were very tasteless. The pasta was set in a watery cream sauce and had little favor. The chicken was not too spicy and was sliced and placed on top. We enjoyed the chicken and ate it all off the top of the pasta. The fish tacos also had little taste, and the fish was very dry. Although the menu mentioned a slaw and chipotle sauce, the slaw did not add much flavor to the tacos and I never found the chipotle sauce. I ordered the shellfish chowder as well, which was very good. The soup had chunks of shrimp, clams and mussels and was creamy, with a little kick, which I enjoyed. Drinks: We both ordered the Ultimate Pineapple drink which is a Pina Colada mixed with a strawberry frozen drink mixture and served inside of a pineapple shell. The drink was on the sweeter side, and I really enjoyed it. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and recommended several entrée and appetizer options, which we appreciated. He was very upset about forgetting to place our appetizer order and was apologetic. He was the only server we interacted with, but observing other tables, all servers appeared very friendly and helpful. Ambiance: Although the music was not outside the day we went to Bahama Breeze, there was Caribbean music playing which I enjoyed. If it wasn't for the 60-degree weather, I would have thought I was on an island. I look forward to enjoying another drink on the patio when there is a live musician this summer. Overall I think this place deserves another try. Although our entrees were not very good, the drinks and ambiance (along with the prior recommendation from a friend) will bring me to try Bahama Breeze once more.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I love coming here just so I can sit outside on the patio area. On Fridays they have a live singer/band playing in the patio area which is pretty cool. The food is pretty good as well as their very tropical drinks (try their pineapple coconut martini!). My only gripe with this place is that their happy hour hours are too short. I usually come here with coworkers for happy hour which is Monday-Friday from 4-6 however, by the time we get there get seated (even if we get there at 4) and get our drinks it's not enough time. The drinks usually take a little while to come out as it does get busy so, by the time you're done with your first drink it's already 5:30 so happy hour turns into a 2 drink special -_-! Other than that it's a very cool place to go sit outside, eat, and enjoy the weather and some music. It's also usually a different band/singer playing each Friday.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"Ambiance/Decor/Atmosphere: The overall appearance of this franchise was very open, wide, airy, clean, and more upscale than Olive Garden and Red Lobster.  Whatever island decor contained within felt out of place honestly.  It is quite a nice looking restaurant on the inside though. Noise/sound level: Average at the worst, this Bahamas Breeze is pretty big so the sound level doesn't get too obnoxious making it relatively enjoyable to conversate with your guests. Menu: Slightly large but focused on Caribbean fare with quite a few appealing dishes Service: Not too good but not horrendous either, waited like twenty minutes for our food but the server really dropped the ball bringing out someone else's cold food.  My wife ordered mojo marinated pulled pork with sauce on the side which was brought to another patron and eaten off of.  So, instead of asking the kitchen to refire the waitress brought a luke warm appetizer and had the nerves to ask if it was alright.  Unfortunately, my wife was hungry and took the meal only to complain about it later.  Under no circumstances should have that dish made it to the table, let alone the waitress ask if it was ok to eat cold food. Food: My wife had the mojo marinated pulled pork which was kind of cold and not tasty, and she had the Peruvian corn cakes which were dry as dirt and chewier than Gummy bears.  Do yourself a favor and do not ever order them unless you can afford an expensive dentist.  I had the West Indies curry chicken rice bowl which was tasty, but it was definitely an Indian dish with a little bit of pineapple mixed in.  It came with brown curry and naan and tasty like the curry you would get with roti canai. Bar: Fully stocked with good selections of alcohol, and a supposedly homemade red ale. Price: Not too expensive but if you pile on the liquor it can get out of control. Overall: Darden owns this which means it's a Caribbean Red Lobster or Olive Garden trying to compete against Cheeseburger In Paradise.  It's a chain franchise so the food is frozen and microwaved all things considered.  It's a bit more upscale than CBIP with more to offer.  I might go back Oh, and it is ultra inconvenient to even go to this restaurant.  No parking, one way streets, parking deck blocking the road, and fences make it a super headache just to get there unless you come from RT Bumper to Bumper (4).",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"How do you rate a place like this?  It's another (lesser-known) Darden chain that sort of feels like Red Lobster meets a Carnival cruise ship.  Is this a happy marriage?  Depends on who you ask. Originally I was going to walk into the Olive Garden next door since I was tired from shopping and too lazy to go elsewhere.  But I noticed this Bahama breeze joint next door and figured, ""why not"".  The ambiance is decent, and reminds me of a generic tourist trap in any Caribbean island of your choice.  Gaudy colorful decor aside (which, for the record, I didn't mind) - the place was relatively inviting, with friendly hosts and very eager waiters. The menu itself was okay.  The prices were definitely on the higher side than Red Lobster.  Even though the offerings were mostly familiar dishes (burgers, pasta, fish etc) infused with all sorts of Caribbean gobbley gook, in the end it's really just a place that serves heavily seasoned food.  My lady had the fish tacos, which actually looked and tasted pretty good.  It's no bonefish grill, but then again the prices for the lunch combo were very solid. I had some caribbean shrimp pasta, which actually tasted decent.  The sauce was a bit salty and but otherwise I like the taste of the food.  What sort of got me was that the shrimps they used reminded me of the exact same shrimps at Red Lobster.  Different chain, but likely the same source of ingredients. What sort of bugged me was that the prices here, aside from the lunch special, were on the high side for a chain restaurant.  No cheddar biscuits off the top also annoyed me.  Hey I know it's not a Red Lobster, but if you're paying more than RL they should at least throw some bread your way. The service here was also incredibly inconsistent.  When the waiters were actually around, they were friendly and enthusiastic.  But there were also long periods of time when people would vanish, leaving us in this Caribbean theme park by ourselves while we chew on our fingernails. In the end, would I come back?  Probably.  But would I probably expect to wait a long time for my food to get here?   Yes.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I came here to celebrate my friend Heather's birthday. This is one of the nicer chain restaurants that we have in the Paramus, NJ area (and there has to be at least 50 chains here).

I was impressed because the restaurant was super crowded on a Friday evening but they still managed to seat us without a wait. Once seated, a waitress came by pretty quickly to take our drink orders. My friends each had a cool looking tropical drink and I had a nice glass of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay. We had the spinach dip as an appetizer. It was a big portion and came with a lot of freshly made tortilla chips. I liked it but didn't eat too much as we were also ordering dinner. For dinner three of us had the ribs. They were tender and fell off the bone. The barbecue sauce was perfect; not too sweet or spicy. I ordered the fires with it and they were crisp and hot. My vegetarian friend ordered a rice bowl and it came in a big bowl. Portions here are very generous. I ended up taking half of my ribs home (my husband was happy!).

Oddly, on a Saturday night they were not crowded like their Olive Garden neighbors. I think that says something. The other 2 locations (both Jersey) always seem to be crowded. We enjoy the catch of the day. The mango salsa is delicious and fresh only skimpy portion and would have liked more (but couldn't find our server once the food came). I enjoy the fish as much as Legal Seafood and the service at Legal is way more professional. I'm a sucker for palm trees and tropical decor so we ended up here tonight, a quick stroll from the Bergen Mall.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"I have to say I was disappointed at my second visit to Bahama Breeze. My mom loved it so much the first time we went back to celebrate her birthday and it was a BUST. I noticed the restaurant was not packed, which for a Saturday evening I found really odd. Well, we found out why.... Service was terrible, the waitress had a MAJOR attitude. We bought an ice cream cake which was already starting to melt so we asked her to put it in their freezer and I feel she purposely did not as it came out LITERALLY in a BOWL as if it was soup. She even brought out a ladle to further throw it in our faces. Food was mediocre, not as fresh as the last time. Drinks were actually okay, not bad. Will definitely not go back.",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
Can't say too much other than the service is a joke. I must have asked my waiter 3 times for a drink that he kept forgetting. Too busy talking shit to co workers and looking at his phone.

We waited another 20 minutes and finally got a table that fit us all. The service then continued to be terrible with food taking a long time. We told them we had were there for a birthday and asked if we could have a cake with a candle, which we knew they did, we asked 7 different people and no cake came out so we left!

"This was my first time at this location. I used to go to the one in Wayne.  This location is much nicer, especially the outside dining area. I almost felt like I was dining at a resort lounge.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see the guy who performed live music in Wayne was transferred over to this location.  The entertainment gives it a nice tropical touch! As usual drinks were on point.  I got their Top Shelf Margarita and actually had a little buzz from it! My girlfriend and I ordered two Caesar salads, Jerk Chicken Wings, and the Spicy Popcorn shrimp. In the past we went nutty over the Jerk Wings, but this time they were a bit lackluster.  So very disappointing. Maybe they changed the recipe?  The salads were stellar.  Crisp lettuce, large shavings of parmesean, and good dressing (on the side of course) The star dish was the shrimp.  The serving is huge and we loved the dipping sauce (spicy mayo?) The service was less than spectacular.  Our server disappeared and it seemed we had 3 different servers (no not food runners) Basically we saw our main server in the beginning and again when he brought our check (10 minutes after we asked the other 2 servers) If you expect a 20-25% tip then I expect to see you a few times throughout my meal. Overall not a bad chain restaurant.  Food quality is good.  Ambience is nice and tropical.  Good place for a nice ladies night!",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

First time at this joint and I can confidently say I'm highly impressed. The diversification on their drink menu is absolutely baffling and quite delectable. I got a Bahama Mama cocktail and it was delicious and the frozen bahamarita is to die for. The food was exquisite too but the only downside was that the service was a tad slow and the food very long to come out. I understand this place is a popular joint but it seemed as if the servers were paying more attention to certain parties than others.

"Met a friend for a conversation and a bite to eat. The food for what it is, wasn't bed. The service was AWFUL! Dinners arrived within 5 minutes of receiving the appetizer, waitress didn't think enough to ask: Should I keep these warm while you enjoy your apps. I had to flag her down for a water refill, my friend never did get a second glass of iced tea. The waitress acted like she didn't want to be there and clearly didn't want to provide good service. She was slow to respond, not knowledgeable about the menu and she interrupted our conversation without an excuse me to ask how everything was. The final straw was when gave us the check without asking if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea. Of course we needed coffee!!. Then she claimed that they were out of creamer (really), brought milk in a kiddie cup and when asked if it was skim milk (as requested) she said: That's 100% whole skim 1% milk. (whatever that is). Again, for a casual chain eatery the food was fine but the service.......I won't return.",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"this review is just for drinks.  I went there on Saturday with about 6 friends later in the evening like 10:30. We sat outside and there was some live entertainment which was nice. I decided to get something different so I got a pineapple coconut martini. When I got my drink and took my first sip I didn't taste a drop of alcohol. So I swirled it around, thinking ok maybe its at the bottom? SIP... SIP... SIP... still nothing. It was all juice!! In all fairness, the waiter did not pour the drink so it wasn't his fault. I said to him, I don't mean to be a jerk but there was ZERO alcohol in this. He immediately apologized and said he would take it off the bill, then I switched to beer.

"We like coming here for the outdoor seating during nice weather. They have a live band that is nice as well. The food is decent, but definitely not Caribbean food which they claim they have if you are looking for authentic or even close. I ordered the ""Calypso Shrimp Fettuccine"" which was marked as one of the spicier dishes and there was absolutely no special seasoning that one would think it's any different from your regular shrimp pasta dishes from an Olive Garden.

"I came here on a Saturday evening with my husband and  7 year old daughter at around 7 pm. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. We have enjoyed this chain a few times in Orlando and were excited that it's now here in the tri states. I also got a $10 off coupon by email so it was worth the wait. After our experience here, I realize why the wait is so long. We ordered the Peruvian corn cakes for appetizer. The mango salsa makes these tasty. We were almost done eating when the waitress came with plates to eat them on. Not good. For entrees we both ordered rice bowls. One Chipotle beef and one Mahi mahi and shrimp. We loved these. The mahi was a little overcooked for me but we loved the flavors for both bowls. Huge portion. Every bite of the beef bowl had beef that was flavorful and tender. These are very filling. My daughter had chicken tenders from kids menu. Typical stuff but I liked that it came with fruit. Then the check came! We were too full for dessert but it would have been nice to be asked! I didn't even have a chance to give her my coupon. When I told her about my coupon she said no problem, she will take care of it. That she did. I looked at the bill after she factored in my coupon and I was charged for a refill of soda and a refill for my daughter's Apple juice. The waitress blamed the system and apologized and went back again. Overall, we liked the food. The waitress was pleasant and sweet but did not do her job well. This is why there is such a long wait. We could have been up and out of there fifteen minutes sooner if she hadn't messed up our bill. And what if we did want dessert?! Or even a cup of coffee!?",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST HAPPY HOUR!!!! Okay, I love this place's happy hour. The drinks are half-off or around that and really good. I had a bahamatini and it came with an extra shot of cactus rum and, it was definitely a lot of alcohol in that drink. My mother, who can hardly taste alcohol anymore took a sip and could tell that it was a strong drink. They also have $2 beers which seemed pretty good, too, though I am not a fan of beer. Their appetizers are half-price during happy hour and they are incredible. Their beef empanadas are large and flavourful, bursting with beef and potatoes and other yumminess. They are a good filling-to-dough ratio and very flavourful. Their firecracker shrimp are in the same vein as ""bang bang"" shrimp from Bonefish grill, except better. The fry on them is much lighter which lets more of the shrimp flavor shine through, and the dipping sauce has a great garlic flavour to it. While I am not a huge fan of eating the wing of a chicken, I cannot deny the Jamaican chicken wings have a fantastic flavor to them. Though, not a fan of the whole-wing as it's difficult to eat, the sauce is really great and they chicken is flavourful. I also had the ropa vieja tacos which, although they did not stand out as much in the meal, were still delicious in their own right.

"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants to begin with and it seems that every time I go to one, my suspicions are confirmed. The service is horrible, food is mediocre, and your'e pushed in and out of a table so fast you don't even know what just happened. I went here with a friend who had tried it in Atlanta and liked it. As soon as our butts touched the seat, our waitress was in front of us asking what we wanted. Excuse me, but I haven't even glanced at the menu, let alone actually opened it to make a decision. She gave us approximately 30 seconds to ""think about things"" and then returned for a drink order and appetizers. We quickly chose thinking maybe then things would slow down a bit. Our waitress walked by our table with our drinks, quickly did a 180 and then came back realizing she was about to deliver them to the wrong people. We were then asked for our dinner order. She stood staring at us, not asking or caring whether we needed more time. I chose on the spot and figured, at least now she'll leave us alone for a bit. Nope. Our appetizers and entrees were delivered at the same time. Thrown in front of us by food runners with no explanation. When our waitress said ""Oh, great, you got everything."" I asked why our apps came WITH our dinners instead of before. She gave a longwinded answer about 2 minutes and 4 minutes and ""I don't know. I can put the appetizer in the back if you want."" Oh, that seems like a great solution. On top of her pushy nature from the start, she was rude and always acted like we were inconveniencing HER. I am a waitress too; it's YOUR job to wait on us. We weren't rude or difficult, just looking for halfway decent service and appetizers that are served before dinner. Anyway, after all this, the food was exactly what I anticipated. Mediocre.

The drink the gentlemen ordered next to me was incorrect. -I watched a server over pour a blended smoothly and wipe off the excess on the wall- the bartender then took the drink from her and wiped it ""clean"" with a dirty towel, then tossed the towel on the floor. -I wouldn't have left this review because the bartender and the food runner who we served us were pleasant enough and clearly busy, but this is where it gets obnoxious -We left our card in the check presenter at the bar, I was put on hold for nearly 5 minutes before whoever answered the phone even asked our name.

"Bahama Breeze is to Caribbean food what Cheesecake Factory is to food period. It's sort of like someone who has never eaten this food decided to mix as many elements as possible and hope everyone would be too tired from shopping to care. There were some interesting things and some things that were just way off. To start we had Painkillers, which were rum and some other stuff. Pretty heavy on the rum but didn't exactly kill any pain. Not an awful drink but not the best thing in the world either. We also had the chicken tostones which were actually fried plantain (tostones) topped with a little chicken, some type of strange sofrito and tons of cheese. I can't say I disliked it, but it was strange. It did help to soak up the painkiller though. We also got yucca fries which were really good and BBQ pork topped sweet plantains. That was not a bad appetizer. One of our appetizers never left the kitchen, so I was sort of sad about that but I was full once the appetizers were done. For entree I ordered the chipotle beef bowl which was huge. It wasn't that great, just a large portion. My friend and I agreed that had it been a smaller serving we probably wouldn't have realized it didn't taste that great and so it wouldn't have ruined the meal. The little one had a grilled chicken breast which was apparently amazing. The hubby had the jerk chicken which was in no way even close to being authentic. Service is not awful but not stellar. There's a one man band singing and playing while you eat which is an interesting touch but I do get annoyed when Marley isn't sung properly and Redemption Song sounds weak and it's ironically being played in a chain restaurant in the U.S. that dumbs down all manner of things that are Caribbean.

"Typical chain with subpar food. The decor is impressive at first:  cavernous ceiling with a thatched roof and Carribean-tiki themes. However, it is extremely dark and loud.  So dark that we needed our cell phone light to read the menu.  And screaming children that were everywhere just add to the flawed atmosphere.  Definitely NOT a date night location. The standout for me were the drinks.  I had the Mojito which was great: strong, nice mint flavor and I liked the sugarcane garnish. My husband enjoyed his Rum Painkiller; a nice touch is that they grate fresh nutmeg tableside over the top of your drink. Sadly, after drinks, the meal went downhill.  You have to pay for chips and salsa; they are not complimetary.  They  had absolutely NO salt on them at all.  Additionally, the salsa was very hot---like jalapeno hot....but our server insisted it was just fresh tomato and onion.  ??? The coconut shrimp appetizer were just ok. I ordered the grilled salmon salad.  My piece of salmon was cooked nicely, unfortunately, the reset of the salad was just horrible.  Warm, wilted greens with an super vinegary dressing.  I hated it. I tried my husband's paella and it was bland. The bar scene was very nice with flat screens to watch a baseball game and there was a great steel drum player rocking out some nice  live music.  Sadly, this only added to the volume of the  screaming toddlers and they began to dance and sing to his reggae beats.

Great food and great ambiance! The price was also good! I recommend getting their piña coladas cause they are awesome!! It's just crowded cause a lot of people dine there even on weekdays so the service might be a little slow but they're all still friendly.

Came here for a family dinner on Saturday and everyone was satisfied! The service we received from Daniel was beyond exceptional! My only complaint would be the ultimate pina coloda was too sweet and barely any alcohol. The jerk skillet shrimp with warm bread is always a hit! Mom had the chicken quesadilla which was good and my brother waited a while for the steak with mash & broccoli but was well worth it.. cooked to perfection! The kids had their share of delicious bites as well!,4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"Jimmy Buffet's cheeseburger in hell meets houlihans is how I would describe eating here. The food is just average chain food, decent burger, nicely seasoned but kind of dry in the center, despite being ordered medium rare. I did like the chicken tortilla soup, it was spicy which I am a sucker for. Service was nice and I enjoyed eating outside on a cool summer night. The live music was a nice touch too. I'd come back if someone else wanted to go, but I'm in no rush to revisit this place.",3.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

Another chain restaurant that simply misses the mark. The hamburgers seemed like they were frozen and not fresh. The salads also are a disappointment .

"I go here mostly for the happy hour and it is definitely top notch. Happy hour applies to the normal early evening 4-7 as well as 9-close for 6 days a week. Food is excellent and the service is great as well, the décor is nothing fancy, but the tropical vibe is a nice touch. This place is a better than average chain restaurant great for friends and families. I would choose this over Apple-bee's, Fridays, Chili's, if wanting to try something new. Bathrooms have mouthwash for its customers, which I think is a nice gesture. Parking is valet, which doesn't make any sense to me, so you must park at mall if you don't want valet. Overall great place to drink, eat and hang out.",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"Totally agreed with another yelper that this is a chain restaurant. However last week had an awesome jerk chicken pasta with mushrooms and asparagus.  It was delish as was the margarita. The 5 stars is in fact for the waitress who was super friendly, upbeat and extremely nice. She told us when she first came over she was only there 5 days today and I have to say her natural customer service and personality will make her the best. She explained that she will answer any questions we may have and if she can't she will find the answer. She was a pleasure to deal with and I only wish I remember her name.",5.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I have been here several times since they opened and this location is very good. This is a very good substitute for Red Lobster people who might want a little more kick into their seafood or anyone who wants a little kick into anything their meal. The menu changes every season, so it might not be useful for me to mention dishes on the menu. The foods can be a little on the spicy side, so if you don't like it hot ask your server. The atmosphere is like a cruise line, i went there on the weekends and they had a steel drum band playing music. It can be dark, and some areas have cold drafts from the a/c, I don't mind since I'm usually warm but some of my friends hated it. The drinks here are also very delicious and original. Service has always been above average. The staff is very friendly and welcoming especially to the first timers.",5.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"Ok, so I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. They are never very good. Except for this one! I've been here like 4 or 5 times. Each time I try something different (always seafood) and every time I  have been pleasantly surprised! Everything tasted fresh, and had very interesting seasonings. The first time I came, I had a chef specialty, a seared ahi tuna salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, edamame and some other veggies. It was so fresh, the ahi tuna was amazing and all the veggies were crisp, even the dressing was delicious. Since I've had their clam chowder, crab stack, ahi tuna stack, fish taco, coconut shrimp and probably another app or two. I have never been disappointed. The freshness reminds me of the fresh fish you get when you're on the Islands. The chef in the kitchen is definitely doing a good job. ****I've only had seafood from here, so I have no idea what the rest of the menu is like The coffee is also good! which wins them a special place in my heart. The decor looks like any resort in the caribbean, and on weekends they have a steel drum player which is really cool ( I love the steel drums!) They also have really good happy hour and late night night specials. Now why I deducted a star. My review has been amazing so far, so why only 4 stars? The drinks. Because it is a chain, they have to regulate how strong their mixed drinks are, meaning that they taste like juice! Stick to the beer people. They have a decent variety. The service isn't great either. They are VERY slow. like island slow, and I'm from an island so I know I don't know if it 's because they are new? or have new staff? but they need a server training or something! Other then that, this has become one of my new go to spots. I'm always looking for an excuse to go!",4.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze
"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants but there are a few good ones (like Jose Tejas).  Bahama Breeze is NOT one of the good ones.  It's pretty much Olive Garden's Caribbean cousin. To start:  The wait time was 45 minutes so we decided to grab a table next to the bar that was open.  We gave our drink order.  My gf ordered a white sangria.  Instead she got a glass of white wine with ginger ale and 2 small pieces of diced apple.   Last time we checked, that isn't how a white sangria was made, so we sent it back for something else. The appetizer came - ahi tuna stacks, which was actually decent. However, we still weren't given napkins or utensils at this point.  I know the place was busy, but that should be the FIRST thing you receive. The entree was the straw that broke the camels back.  I got Jamaican Jerk chicken.  It didn't taste bad, but wasn't hot temperature wise.  Was probably sitting out a few minutes minutes before it was brought over.  Also, the quality of chicken was bad.  It was extremely chewy and hard to cut through.  The cinnamon sweet potato mash side is how it sounds.  Too sweet to be included with an entree. Won't be back again.  Applebees, TJIFs or Houlihans have better alternatives than this faux Caribbean restaurant.",1.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"So I have been here twice, initially with my girlfriend for dinner and the other with my family for dinner also. This was my first time experiencing Bahama Breeze and ""Island"" food as they described it to me.  To be honest I had higher expectations for the food quality, service, and overall quality of the restaurant. Atmosphere: the restaurant is dark.  I don't know if its because its dinner time or what but the lighting during my two visits was poor, booth and table areas.  There really wasn't anything that screamed island paradise either. Service: the servers were polite and attentive in the beginning but often forget to check up on their tables. I was waiting for waters and for someone to take my order for quite a while.  Another poor poor poor inexcusable part was during my second visit with my family almost all the silverware and napkins were filthy.  I'm not talking about a small white spot or something.  I am talking about crust on the utensils and the napkins. Food: The food was alright.  The sauces were flavorful but I can say that I have had better.  The appetizers were better then the entrees.  I ordered the fish tacos and Paella and they were so-so.  I tried their special beer which was close to a yuengling draft and i also tried their zombie which was just strong rum on rum on rum. Price: The prices are not that bad.  You're looking to spend around $20-25 per person for a decent dinner or lunch. Pros: if you are willing to try it out go for it. I recommend the coconut shrimp and the chicken wings with your choice of sauces. Cons: dont have high expectations.  Its a casual place to eat a meal and possibly enjoy some margaritas, if made properly. Conclusion: I do see myself coming back but just for the apps.  they just started a new half off apps after 9:00 pm Sun-Thur so i might give the food another shot.  Expect an updated review in the months to come.",2.0,"1600 Bergen Town Ctr, Paramus, NJ 07652",Bahama Breeze

"Chain eateries.  There's so many.  This one, though, yells Caribbean with it's name.  Strange that the menu doesn't.  There was Asian, Italian, Latin...all there to schmooze and confuse. Why try a warm goat cheese dip with tortilla chips in a Bahama themed place?  I dunno, but we did.  It was OK. The conch fritters, definitely a Bahamanian treat, were good.  Coconut shrimp was a crazy huge portion for an entree, and was very good...not too sweet as some places identical fare are. The fish tacos, stuffed with tilapia, looked good and got positive reviews, too.  I had a grilled veggie sandwich which was not good at all.  Chopped up veggies, cheese, and a terrible, mustardy tasting semi-clear sauce on the side.  Fries, too. Service was good, decent atmosphere, but the menu needs a couple more vegetarian items for it to draw us back here.

"Good God Bahama Breeze! If the food you offer is really like that down in the Bahamas then I better call my travel agent and cancel my reservations! I ordered the Mojo-Marinated Pulled Pork & Chicken Empanadas from the SNACKS menu and everyone else in my party ordered from the Appetizers menu...so shouldn't take too long right? GUESS AGAIN! I think they actually take their name too seriously and fly their orders from the Bahamas to us, all in the same night. We waited 20 minutes to put our order in and then another 45 for our food and mind you it was only 4 of us and the restaurant was empty. Now I know why their food is so expensive because of the First Class delivery charges they get from the Bahamas everyday! Everyone's food was cold and the pulled pork was absolutely disgusting...More like Bahama FREEZE! I dread the day I get shipped to a senior citizens home because this is the stuff they would serve, but WORSE. And the Chicken Empanadas were nonexistent.

"**3.5 rating** Have my standards gone down? Why is this place rated so low? I thought this was pretty good for a chain. Of course the highlight of the dinner were the amazingly large and tasty cocktails. Zombie was obviously strong, but my favorite was the frozen bahamarita, which came with a shot of something on the side.  So delicious. The capirosca was too sweet, had to send it back. the spinach dip and the tostones with chicken were my favorite appetizers. The cilantro chicken was good. I didn't like the way the beef dish was served in strips. There was an hour wait on a Saturday night. This part i didn't like, however when we sat at the table we were greeted immediately and the waitress was on top of everything. No delays with or food or drinks. She was very nice and helpful.

"I've been meaning to write a Yelp review for this but never got around to it until now. But anyway, I went here for my birthday dinner on the 27th and it was so disappointing. I read reviews beforehand but thought I should give it the benefit of the doubt, however it was an overall disappointing experience. Our waitress was very inattentive. It took her 30 minutes to give us our waters and if the place was crowded, I would have understood completely but it was not. In addition, she got my friends order of a Piña Colada mixed up with another drink even though my friend mentioned she wanted the Piña Colada twice. Furthermore (and this is the best part), my other friend had GLASS in her drink which she thought was ice before it got stuck in her tooth. That just really baffled me, and when we mentioned it to the waitress and the manager, it was as if they could care less. A waiter we called over before while waiting for our waitress acted more sympathetic to our situation and was actually the one who called the manager over for us. By the end of the night, they were only going to take the one drink my friend with the glass in her drink off the bill, but after compromising with the manager (which we shouldn't have had to tbh), he took all our drinks off the bill. So at least that was an upside. But if ya haven't guessed already, I definitely will not be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon.

"The ambiance of this place is great, dim lighting and nice and sets a good mood. IF you're in a mood to watch some sports, you have to sit at the bar. That's the only place they have the TVs for view. The appetizers here are generous in portion and taste great. Usually 2-3 appetizers can substitute for dinner for two. I often choose from the firecracker shrimp, lobster quesadilla & cheeseburger sliders. I've gotten the entrees once before and there was a lot left to be desired Drinks here are limited in selection (for beers). But if you're into cocktails they seem to have a good variety.  Bar tenders are friendly and service is pretty quick. If you can get here for happy hour the specials are a steal with appetizers half off. I'm docking stars bc the happy hour range is short ending at 6pm and honestly the appetizers are better than the entrees. Wish they had more beer selection as well.
